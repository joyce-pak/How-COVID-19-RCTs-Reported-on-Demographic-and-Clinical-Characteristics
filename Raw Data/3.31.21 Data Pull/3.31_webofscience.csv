OBJECTIVE To confirm the previous finding that high-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate (with double the amount of amoxicillin) may be superior to standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate in adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This double-blind, comparative-effectiveness randomized clinical trial was conducted from February 26, 2018, through May 10, 2020, at the academic primary care internal medicine and pediatrics practice of Albany Medical Center, located in Cohoes, New York. Participants included adults aged 18 years or older who were prescribed amoxicillin plus clavulanate for acute bacterial sinusitis diagnosed in accordance with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. INTERVENTIONS Amoxicillin 875 mg with clavulanate 125 mg plus either placebo (standard dose) or amoxicillin 875 mg (high dose) twice a day for 7 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary efficacy outcome was a global rating of a lot better or no symptoms at the end of 3 days of treatment using a Global Rating of Improvement scale, with outcomes ranging from 1(a lot worse) to 6 (no symptoms). The primary adverse effect outcome was severe diarrhea at 3 or 10 days after the start of treatment. RESULTS At an unplanned interim analysis prompted by COVID-19 restrictions, 157 of a projected 240 participants had been enrolled (mean age, 48.5 [range, 18.7-84.0] years; 117 women [74.5%]), with 79 randomized to the standard dose and 78 to the high dose; 9 and 12, respectively, withdrew or were lost to follow-up before the assessment of the primary outcome. At day 3, 31 of 70 participants (44.3%) in the standard-dose group reported a global rating of a lot better or no symptoms, as did 24 of 66 (36.4%) in the high-dose group, for a difference of -7.9% (95% CI. -24.4% to 8.5%; P = .35). The study was, therefore, stopped for futility. Diarrhea was common in both groups by day 3, with any diarrhea reported in 29 of 71 participants (40.8%) receiving the standard dose and 28 of 65 (43.1%) receiving the high dose and severe diarrhea reported in 5 of 71(7.0%) and 5 of 65 (7.7%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of this randomized clinical trial suggest that adults treated for clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis did not appear to benefit from taking high-dose compared with standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate.","[Gregory, Jennifer; Huynh, Bichtram; Tayler, Brittany] Albany Med Ctr Hosp, Med & Pediat, Cohoes, NY USA; [Gregory, Jennifer] Englewood Hlth Med Ctr, Englewood, NJ USA; [Korgaonkar-Cherala, Chaitali] Albany Med Coll, Albany, NY 12208 USA; [Korgaonkar-Cherala, Chaitali] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Obstet Gynecol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Garrison, Gina] Albany Coll Pharm & Hlth Sci, Dept Pharm Practice, Albany, NY USA; [Ata, Ashar] Albany Med Coll, Dept Surg, Albany, NY 12208 USA; [Ata, Ashar] Albany Med Coll, Dept Emergency Med, Albany, NY 12208 USA; [Sorum, Paul] Albany Med Coll, Dept Internal Med, Albany, NY 12208 USA; [Sorum, Paul] Albany Med Coll, Dept Pediat, Albany, NY 12208 USA","Sorum, P (corresponding author), Albany Med Ctr, Med & Pediat, 1019 New Loudon Rd, Cohoes, NY 12047 USA.",sorump@amc.edu,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",2574-3805,,,JAMA NETW OPEN,JAMA Netw.

However, to our knowledge, the consequences of mask wearing on communication between surgeons and patients have not been studied. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of clear vs standard covered masks on communication during surgical clinic encounters. DESIGN This randomized clinical trial examined communication between surgeons and their patients when surgeons wore clear vs covered masks in surgical outpatient clinics at a single academic medical center. New patients were recruited from participating surgeons' clinic schedules. INTERVENTIONS Surgeons wore either clear masks or covered masks for each clinic visit with a new patient, based on a per-visit randomization plan. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome measures included patient perceptions of (1) surgeon communication and (2) trust in surgeons, as well as (3) quantitative assessments and (4) qualitative assessments regarding patient impressions of the surgeon's mask. After the clinic encounter, patients completed a verbal survey including validated Clinician and Group Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems questions. Additional questions involved surgeon empathy, trust, and the patient's impression of the surgeon's mask. Data were analyzed by comparing patient data in the clear vs covered groups using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests, and comments were analyzed for themes. RESULTS Two hundred patients were enrolled from 15 surgeons' clinics spanning 7 subspecialties. When surgeons wore a clear mask, patients rated their surgeons higher for providing understandable explanations (clear, 95 of 100 [95%] vs covered, 78 of 100 [78%]; P < .001), demonstrating empathy (clear, 99 [99%] vs covered, 85 [85%]; P < .001), and building trust (clear, 94 [94%] vs covered, 72 [72%]; P < .001). Patients preferred clear masks (clear, 100 [100%] vs covered, 72 [72%]; P < .001), citing improved surgeon communication and appreciation for visualization of the face. Conversely, 8 of 15 surgeons (53%) were unlikely to choose the clear mask over their standard covered mask. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This randomized clinical trial demonstrates that patients prefer to see their surgeon's face. Surgeons who wore clear masks were perceived by patients to be better communicators, have more empathy, and elicit greater trust. Because masks will remain part of the health care landscape for some time, deliberate attention to preserving communication within the surgeon-patient relationship is warranted.","[Kratzke, Ian M.; Cox, Chase; Ollila, David W.; Kapadia, Muneera R.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Surg, 100 Manning Dr,Burnett Womack Bldg,Ste 4038, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Rosenbaum, Marcy E.] Univ Iowa, Dept Family Med, Iowa City, IA USA","Kapadia, MR (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Surg, 100 Manning Dr,Burnett Womack Bldg,Ste 4038, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",muneera_kapadia@med.unc.edu,,,,,,32,1,1,0,0,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",2168-6254,2168-6262,,JAMA SURG,JAMA Surg.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1001/jamasurg.2021.0836,,MAR 2021,7,Surgery,Surgery,QV3VB,WOS:000627901700001,33704389,Bronze,,,2021-03-31,

In all-corner patients, contemporary DES have shown excellent safety and efficacy, but data on diabetic patients are scarce. Separately for the BIO-RESORT and BIONYX trials, we assessed the 2-year clinical outcomes of diabetic patients, treated with various contemporary drug-eluting stents (DES). Methods: We performed two prespecified secondary analyses of two randomized DES trials, which both stratified for diabetes. The main endpoint was target vessel failure (WI), a composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization. Follow-up was finished before the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: In BIO-RESORT, 624/3514 (17.8%) had diabetes: 211 received Orsiro sirolimus-eluting stents (SES), 203 Synergy everolimus-eluting stents (EES), and 210 Resolute Integrity zotarolimus-eluting stents (RI-ZES). TVF did not differ between SES (10.2%) and EES (10.0%) versus RI-ZES (12.7%) (SES vs. RI-ZES HR:0.78, 95%-CI [0.44-1.40]; p = 0.40, EES vs. RI-ZES HR:0.79, 95%-CI [0.44-1.40]; p = 0.42). In BIONYX, 510/2488 (20.5%) patients had diabetes: 250 received SES and 260 Resolute Onyx zotarolimus-eluting stents (RO-ZES). There was no difference in TVF between SES (10.7%) versus RO-ZES (12.2%) (HR:0.88, 95%-CI [0.52-148]; p = 0.63). Conclusions: There was no difference in 2-year clinical outcome among patients with diabetes, who were treated with SES, or EES. versus RI-ZES. In addition there was no difference in clinical outcome in diabetic patients, who were treated with SES versus RO-ZES.

Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is a well-known adjunctive treatment for pain management, wound healing, lymphedema, and cellulitis. PBMT uses light to start a cascade of photochemical reactions that lead to local and systemic anti-inflammatory effects at multiple levels and that stimulate healing. Numerous empirical studies of PBMT for patients with pulmonary disease such as pneumonia, COPD and asthma suggest that PBMT is a safe and effective adjunctive treatment. Recent systematic reviews suggest that PBMT may be applied to target lung tissue in COVID-19 patients. In this preliminary study, we evaluated the effect of adjunctive PBMT on COVID-19 pneumonia and patient clinical status. Patients and Methods: We present a small-scale clinical trial with 10 patients randomized to standard medical care or standard medical care plus adjunctive PBMT. The PBMT group received four daily sessions of near-infrared light treatment targeting the lung tissue via a Multiwave Locked System (MLS) laser. Patient outcomes were measured via blood work, chest x-rays, pulse oximetry and validated scoring tools for pneumonia. Results: PBMT patients showed improvement on pulmonary indices such as SMART-COP, BCRSS, RALE, and CAP (Community-Acquired Pneumonia questionnaire). PBMT-treated patients showed rapid recovery, did not require ICU admission or mechanical ventilation, and reported no long-term sequelae at 5 months after treatment. In the control group, 60% of patients were admitted to the ICU for mechanical ventilation. The control group had an overall mortality of 40%. At a 5-month follow-up, 40% of the control group experienced long-term sequelae. Conclusion: PBMT is a safe and effective potential treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia and improves clinical status in COVID-19 pneumonia.","[Vetrici, Mariana A.] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Biol Sci, Lethbridge, AB, Canada; [Mokmeli, Soheila] Canadian Opt & Laser Ctr, Training Inst, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Bohm, Andrew R.] Lenox Hill Hosp, Dept Orthoped, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Monici, Monica] Univ Florence, Dept Expt & Clin Biomed Sci, ASA Res Div, ASA Campus JL, Florence, Italy; [Sigman, Scott A.] Lowell Gen Hosp, Dept Orthoped, 295 Varnum Ave, Lowell, MA 01863 USA","Sigman, SA (corresponding author), Lowell Gen Hosp, Dept Orthoped, 295 Varnum Ave, Lowell, MA 01863 USA.",sasigmanmd@icloud.com,,,,,,53,0,0,0,0,DOVE MEDICAL PRESS LTD,ALBANY,"PO BOX 300-008, ALBANY, AUCKLAND 0752, NEW ZEALAND",,1178-7031,,J INFLAMM RES,J.

Emerging prehabilitation services may be informed by early RCT data but can be limited in informing real-world program development. Pragmatic trials emphasize external validity and generalizability to understand and advise intervention development and implementation in clinical settings. This paper presents the methodology of a pragmatic prehabilitation trial to complement emerging phase III clinical trials and inform implementation strategies. Methods This is a pilot pragmatic clinical trial conducted in a large academic hospital in Toronto, Ontario, Canada to assess feasibility of clinical implementation and derive estimates of effectiveness. Feasibility data include program referral rates, enrolment and attrition, intervention adherence and safety, participant satisfaction, and barriers and facilitators to programming. The study aims to receive 150 eligible referrals for adult, English-speaking, preoperative oncology patients with an identified indication for prehabilitation (e.g., frailty, deconditioning, malnutrition, psychological distress). Study participants undergo a baseline assessment and shared-decision making regarding the intervention setting: either facility-based prehabilitation or home-based prehabilitation. In both scenarios, participants receive an individualized exercise prescription, stress-reduction psychological support, nutrition counseling, and protein supplementation, and if appropriate, smoking cessation program referrals. Secondary objectives include estimating intervention effects at the week prior to surgery and 30 and 90 days postoperatively. Outcomes include surgical complications, postoperative length of stay, mortality, hospital readmissions, physical fitness, psychological well-being, and quality of life. Data from participants who decline the intervention but consent for research-related access to health records will serve as comparators. The COVID-19 pandemic required the introduction of a 'virtual program' using only telephone or internet-based communication for screening, assessments, or intervention was introduced. Conclusion This pragmatic trial will provide evidence on the feasibility and viability of prehabilitation services delivered under usual clinical conditions. Study amendments due to the COVID-19 pandemic are presented as strategies to maintain prehabilitation research and services to potentially mitigate the consequences of extended surgery wait times.","[Santa Mina, Daniel] Univ Toronto, Fac Kinesiol & Phys Educ, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Santa Mina, Daniel; Sellers, Daniel; Alibhai, Shabbir M.

However, the clinical efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma is unclear.MethodsThe Passive Immunity Trial for Our Nation (PassITON) is a multicenter, placebo-controlled, blinded, randomized clinical trial being conducted in the USA to provide high-quality evidence on the efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma as a treatment for adults hospitalized with symptomatic disease. Adults hospitalized with COVID-19 with respiratory symptoms for less than 14days are eligible. Enrolled patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 unit (200-399mL) of COVID-19 convalescent plasma that has demonstrated neutralizing function using a SARS-CoV-2 chimeric virus neutralization assay. Study treatments are administered in a blinded fashion and patients are followed for 28days. The primary outcome is clinical status 14days after study treatment as measured on a 7-category ordinal scale assessing mortality, respiratory support, and return to normal activities of daily living. Key secondary outcomes include mortality and oxygen-free days. The trial is projected to enroll 1000 patients and is designed to detect an odds ratio <= 0.73 for the primary outcome.DiscussionThis trial will provide the most robust data available to date on the efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma for the treatment of adults hospitalized with acute moderate to severe COVID-19. These data will be useful to guide the treatment of COVID-19 patients in the current pandemic and for informing decisions about whether developing a standardized infrastructure for collecting and disseminating convalescent plasma to prepare for future viral pandemics is indicated.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT04362176.

We attempted to verify the effectiveness and safety of tocilizumab therapy in COVID-19 and identify patients most likely to benefit from this treatment. We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label multicenter trial among COVID-19 patients. The patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either tocilizumab in addition to standard care or standard care alone. The cure rate, changes of oxygen saturation and interference, and inflammation biomarkers were observed. Thirty-three patients were randomized to the tocilizumab group, and 32 patients to the control group. The cure rate in the tocilizumab group was higher than that in the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant (94.12% vs. 87.10%, rate difference 95% CI-7.19%-21.23%, P = 0.4133). The improvement in hypoxia for the tocilizumab group was higher from day 4 onward and statistically significant from day 12 (P = 0.0359). In moderate disease patients with bilateral pulmonary lesions, the hypoxia ameliorated earlier after tocilizumab treatment, and less patients (1/12, 8.33%) needed an increase of inhaled oxygen concentration compared with the controls (4/6, 66.67%; rate difference 95% CI-99.17% to-17.50%, P = 0.0217). No severe adverse events occurred. More mild temporary adverse events were recorded in tocilizumab recipients (20/34, 58.82%) than the controls (4/31, 12.90%). Tocilizumab can improve hypoxia without unacceptable side effect profile and significant influences on the time virus load becomes negative. For patients with bilateral pulmonary lesions and elevated IL-6 levels, tocilizumab could be recommended to improve outcome.","[Wang, Dongsheng; Xu, Fei; Wang, Xiaojing; Chen, Jun; Xia, Daqing; Hu, Xiaowen; Mei, Xiaodong; Xu, Xiaoling] Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Pulm & Crit Care Med, Affiliated Hosp 1, Anhui Prov Hosp, Hefei 230001, Peoples R China; [Fu, Binqing; Zhou, Yonggang; Wei, Haiming] Univ Sci & Technol China, Div Life Sci & Med, Hefei 230027, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yun; Yang, Tianjun; Pan, Aijun] Univ Sci & Technol China, Intens Care Unit, Affiliated Hosp 1, Anhui Prov Hosp, Hefei 230001, Peoples R China; [Peng, Zhen] Univ Sci & Technol China, Drug Clin Trail Inst, Affiliated Hosp 1, Anhui Prov Hosp,Div Life Sci & Med, Hefei 230001, Peoples R China; [Yang, Dongliang] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Union Hosp, Tongji Med Coll, Dept Infect Dis, Wuhan 430000, Peoples R China; [Han, Mingfeng] Second Peoples Hosp Fuyang, Dept Resp Med, Fuyang 236000, Peoples R China; [Li, Min] Cent South Univ, Xiangya Hosp, Branch Natl Clin Res Ctr Resp Dis,Hunan Prov Clin, Dept Resp Med,Natl Key Clin Specialty,Xiangya Lun, Changsha 410000, Peoples R China; [Sun, Liangye] Anhui Med Univ, Luan Peoples Hosp, Luan 237005, Peoples R China; [Li, Wei] Bengbu Med Coll, Dept Pulm & Crit Care Med, Affiliated Hosp 1, Clin Res Ctr Resp Dis Tumor Anhui Prov, Bengbu 233004, Peoples R China; [Shi, Wei] Anhui Med Univ, Dept Resp Med, Anqing Hosp, Anqing 246000, Peoples R China; [Yao, Xin] Nanjing Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Nanjing 210000, Peoples R China; [Ma, Yan; Zhang, Min] Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Rheumatol & Immunol, Affiliated Hosp 1, Anhui Prov Hosp, Hefei 230001, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yubei] Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Oncol, Affiliated Hosp 1, Anhui Prov Hosp, Hefei 230001, Peoples R China; [Dong, Lin; Wang, Jumei] Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Endocrinol, Affiliated Hosp 1, Anhui Prov Hosp, Hefei 230001, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Xiaoyu] Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Hematol, Affiliated Hosp 1, Anhui Prov Hosp, Hefei 230001, Peoples R China","Mei, XD; Xu, XL (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Pulm & Crit Care Med, Affiliated Hosp 1, Anhui Prov Hosp, Hefei 230001, Peoples R China.; Wei, HM (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Div Life Sci & Med, Hefei 230027, Peoples R China.",ustcwhm@ustc.edu.cn; xxlahh8@ustc.edu.cn,,,Department of Science and Technology of Anhui Province and Health Commission of Anhui Province [202004a07020001]; China National Center for Biotechnology Development [2020YFC0843800],"This work was supported by the Department of Science and Technology of Anhui Province and Health Commission of Anhui Province (No. 202004a07020001) and the China National Center for Biotechnology Development (No. 2020YFC0843800).

We aimed to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and biological effect of administering high-dose intravenous zinc (HDIVZn) to patients with COVID-19. We performed a Phase IIa double-blind, randomized controlled trial to compare HDIVZn to placebo in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We administered trial treatment per day for a maximum of 7 days until either death or hospital discharge. We measured zinc concentration at baseline and during treatment and observed patients for any significant side effects. For eligible patients, we randomized and administered treatment to 33 adult participants to either HDIVZn (n = 15) or placebo (n = 18). We observed no serious adverse events throughout the study for a total of 94 HDIVZn administrations. However, three participants in the HDIVZn group reported infusion site irritation. Mean serum zinc on Day 1 in the placebo, and the HDIVZn group was 6.9 +/- 1.1 and 7.7 +/- 1.6 mu mol/l, respectively, consistent with zinc deficiency. HDIVZn, but not placebo, increased serum zinc levels above the deficiency cutoff of 10.7 mu mol/l (p < .001) on Day 6. Our study did not reach its target enrollment because stringent public health measures markedly reduced patient hospitalizations. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients demonstrated zinc deficiency. This can be corrected with HDIVZn. Such treatment appears safe, feasible, and only associated with minimal peripheral infusion site irritation. This pilot study justifies further investigation of this treatment in COVID-19 patients.","[Patel, Oneel; Chinni, Vidyasagar; El-Khoury, John; Perera, Marlon; Jones, Daryl; Bolton, Damien; Ischia, Joseph] Univ Melbourne, Austin Hlth, Dept Surg, Level 8,Lance Townsend Bldg, Heidelberg, Vic, Australia; [Chinni, Vidyasagar; El-Khoury, John; Perera, Marlon; Bolton, Damien; Ischia, Joseph] Austin Hlth, Dept Urol, Heidelberg, Vic, Australia; [Neto, Ary S.] Monash Univ, Australian & New Zealand Intens Care Res Ctr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Neto, Ary S.; Bellomo, Rinaldo] Univ Melbourne, Ctr Integrated Crit Care, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [McDonald, Christine] Austin Hlth, Dept Resp & Sleep Med, Heidelberg, Vic, Australia; [See, Emily; Jones, Daryl; Bellomo, Rinaldo] Austin Hosp, Dept Intens Care, Heidelberg, Vic, Australia; [Jones, Daryl] Univ Melbourne, Austin Hlth, Dept Infect Dis, Heidelberg, Vic, Australia","Ischia, J (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Austin Hlth, Dept Surg, Level 8,Lance Townsend Bldg, Heidelberg, Vic, Australia.",jjischia@unimelb.edu.au,"Serpa Neto, Ary/D-1927-2012; Perera, Marlon/I-8641-2014","Serpa Neto, Ary/0000-0003-1520-9387; Bellomo, Rinaldo/0000-0002-1650-8939; Perera, Marlon/0000-0002-1138-6389; Patel, Oneel/0000-0001-5628-7205; Bolton, Damien/0000-0002-5145-6783",,,,32,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0146-6615,1096-9071,,J MED VIROL,J.

A small proportion of patients infected with COVID-19 go on to develop pneumonia. We speculated that COVID-19 may be likely to result in psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression. In this study, we conducted an investigation of anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19. Methods: Sixty-five COVID-19 patients were randomly enrolled into this study. Anxiety and depression among participants were measured through the completion of anonymous Chinese-language Zung self-rating anxiety scale and self-rating depression scale questionnaires. Data were analyzed using independent samples t-tests, Mann-Whitney U-tests, and chi(2) tests. Results: The questionnaire results showed that 26.15% and 41.54% of participants suffered from anxiety and depression, respectively, although there was no significantly statistical difference between the proportions of COVID-19 patients with anxiety and depression. Statistically significant differences in employment status, partial pressure of oxygen, and corticosteroid application existed between moderate- and severe COVID-19 patients (P<0.05). In particular, the partial pressure of oxygen was significantly lower in severe COVID-19 patients than in their moderate counter parts (71.31 +/- 23.54 vs. 101.06 +/- 34.43, U= 156, P=0.006). Total lymphocytes was lower in severe group than in moderate group [1.659 +/- 0.643 vs. 0.745 (0.645, 0.928), U=109, P=0.000]. Also, a higher proportion of female than male patients had anxiety (chi(2)=5.388, P=0.02). COVID-19 patients who received antiviral medications also displayed a higher rate of anxiety (chi(2)=4.481, P=0.034). Total lymphocytes between the non-anxiety and anxiety had statistical difference (U=321, P=0.019). Meanwhile, total lymphocytes between the non-depression and depression also had statistical difference (U=389.5, P=0.01). Conclusions: Among patients with COVID-19, females and those treated with antiviral medications were more likely to experience anxiety. In addition, our findings reflected the effect of anxiety and depression on immune system.","[Zhou, Feng] Soochow Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Resp Med, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Feng; Du, Chun-Ling; Wu, Chao-Min; Wang, Ju-Li] Fudan Univ, Zhongshan Hosp, Qingpu Branch, Dept Resp Dis, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Feng; Wang, Rong-Rong; Huang, Han-Ping; Wu, Chao-Min; Qian, Xue-Mei; Li, Wei-Li; Wang, Ju-Li; Jiang, Lv-Yan; Jiang, Hui-Jia; Yu, Wen-Jie] Jinyintan Hosp Wuhan, Dept Infect Dis, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Rong-Rong] Fudan Univ, Zhongshan Hosp, Qingpu Branch, Dept Surg Intens Care Unit, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Qian, Xue-Mei] Fudan Univ, Zhongshan Hosp, Dept Infect Dis, Qingpu Branch, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Wei-Li] Peoples Hosp Zhujiajiao, Dept Internal Med, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Lv-Yan] Fengxian Cent Hosp, Dept Pediat, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Hui-Jia] Fengxian Cent Hosp, Dept Orthoped, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Yu, Wen-Jie] Sijing Hosp Songjiang, Dept Orthoped, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Ke-Bin] Tongji Univ, Sch Med, Shanghai Pulm Hosp, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, 507 Zhengmin Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China","Cheng, KB (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Sch Med, Shanghai Pulm Hosp, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, 507 Zhengmin Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",chengkebin2017@163.com,,,"Science and Technology Commission of Qingpu District, Shanghai [QKY2018-12]","This work was supported by grants from the Science and Technology Commission of Qingpu District, Shanghai (QKY2018-12).",,29,0,0,0,0,AME PUBL CO,SHATIN,"FLAT-RM C 16F, KINGS WING PLAZA 1, NO 3 KWAN ST, SHATIN, HONG KONG 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",2224-5820,2224-5839,,ANN PALLIAT MED,Ann.

A randomized controlled trial follow-up study,SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER,,,English,Article; Early Access,,,,,,Cancer; Supportive care needs; Tele-nursing; Quality of life,,"Purpose In some countries, telephone-based support is one of the key services used for supporting patients with cancer. However, there is a lack of research on the efficacy of this method in Iran. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of tele-nursing on supportive care needs (SCNs) of patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Methods This randomized controlled trial was conducted on 60 patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy who were randomly assigned and allocated to two groups, an intervention group and a control group. Patients' SCNs were assessed in the baseline, and 1 and 2 months after commencement of the intervention using the SCNs Survey -Short Form 34. The data were analyzed through descriptive statistics, t-test, and repeated measure test, by SPSS version 16. Results There were no significant statistical differences in the mean score of dimensions and total SCNs between the two groups in baseline (p>0.05). However, the results showed that the mean score of dimensions and total SCNs in the intervention group were significantly less than the control group, after the intervention (p<0.05). Conclusions Telephone-based support is an effective method to address and reduce SCNs of patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy through increasing access to support for this population especially who may be in rural and remote settings. During the COVID_19 pandemic and given the vulnerability of patients with cancer, telephone support can be used to avoid unnecessary visits to hospitals and reduced the risk of transmitting the virus to the patients.","[Ebrahimabadi, Maryam; Nejat, Nazi] Arak Univ Med Sci, Sch Nursing, Dept Nursing, Basij Sq,Payambar E Azam Complex,Blue Wings, Arak 3848176941, Iran; [Rafiei, Fatemeh] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Hlth, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Ctr Sci Res, Tehran, Iran","Nejat, N (corresponding author), Arak Univ Med Sci, Sch Nursing, Dept Nursing, Basij Sq,Payambar E Azam Complex,Blue Wings, Arak 3848176941, Iran.",mebrahimi141@gmail.com; f.rafiei87@yahoo.com; n.nejat@arakmu.ac.ir,"Ebrahimabadi, Maryam/Q-8939-2018; Nejat, Nazi/G-5793-2016; rafiei, fatemeh/V-2824-2017","Ebrahimabadi, Maryam/0000-0002-8508-3962; Nejat, Nazi/0000-0002-7225-5438; rafiei, fatemeh/0000-0002-1303-8660",Arak University of Medical Sciences [2817],This study was financially supported and approved by Arak University of Medical Sciences (grant no. 2817).,,44,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0941-4355,1433-7339,,SUPPORT CARE CANCER,Support.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity has been reported by CK2 inhibitors in vitro; however, no anti-CK2 clinical approach has been investigated in COVID-19. This trial aimed to explore the safety and putative clinical benefit of CIGB325, an anti-CK2 peptide previously assessed in cancer patients. A monocentric, controlled, and therapeutic exploratory trial of intravenous CIGB-325 in adults hospitalized with COVID-19 was performed. Twenty patients were randomly assigned to receive CIGB-325 (2.5 mg/kg/day during 5-consecutive days) plus standard-of-care (10 patients) or standard-of-care alone (10 patients). Adverse events were classified by the WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology. Parametric and nonparametric statistical analyses were performed according to the type of variable. Considering the small sample size, differences between groups were estimated by Bayesian analysis. CIGB-325 induced transient mild and/or moderate adverse events such as pruritus, flushing, and rash in some patients. Both therapeutic regimens were similar with respect to SARS-CoV-2 clearance in nasopharynx swabs over time. However, CIGB-325 significantly reduced the median number of pulmonary lesions (9.5 to 5.5, p = 0.042) at day 7 and the proportion of patients with such an effect was also higher according to Bayesian analysis (pDif > 0; 0.951). Also, CIGB-325 significantly reduced the CPK (p = 0.007) and LDH (p = 0.028) plasma levels at day 7. Our preliminary findings suggest that this anti-CK2 clinical approach could be combined with standard-of-care in COVID-19 in larger studies.","[Cruz, Leticia R.; Rittoles, Aliusha; Santana, Raul; Garcia, Ariadna; Chacon, Deyli; Thompson, Delvin; Perera, Gustavo; Perez, Jesus; Valido, Yania; Rodriguez, Ralysmay] Cent Hosp Luis Diaz Soto, Havana 19130, Cuba; [Baladron, Idania; Diaz, Pablo A.; Vazquez, Maria M.; Vazquez-Bloomquist, Dania M.; Rosales, Mauro; Ramon, Ailyn C.; Perez, George, V; Guillen, Gerardo; Muzio, Verena; Perera, Yasser; Perea, Silvio E.] Ctr Genet Engn & Biotechnol, Havana 10600, Cuba; [Valenzuela, Carmen] Ctr Mol Immunol, Havana 11600, Cuba; [Gonzalez, Ariel; Torres, Loida] Int Ctr Hlth Pradera, Havana 11600, Cuba; [Reyes, Rafael] Natl Inst Oncol & Radiobiol, Havana 10400, Cuba; [Rosales, Mauro] Univ Havana, Fac Biol, Havana 10400, Cuba; [Perera, Yasser] Yongzhou Zhong Gu Biotechnol Co Ltd, China Cuba Biotechnol Joint Innovat Ctr CCBJIC, Yongzhou 425000, Hunan, Peoples R China","Perea, SE (corresponding author), Ctr Genet Engn & Biotechnol, Havana 10600, Cuba.",silvio.perea@cigb.edu.cu,"Rosales, Mauro/H-1406-2019","Rosales, Mauro/0000-0003-1920-0064","British Embassy in Havana; International Programme of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) [CIGB-300/2020]","This work was supported in part by the British Embassy in Havana with funds of the International Programme of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) (CIGB-300/2020).",,24,0,0,2,2,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",,2575-9108,,ACS PHARMACOL TRANSL,ACS Pharmacol.

It is very significant to explore an optimal clinical trial management model during the outbreak period to provide reference and insight for other clinical trial centers worldwide. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the management strategies used to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on oncology clinical trials. Methods: We implemented a remote management model to maintain clinical trials conducted at Beijing Cancer Hospital, which realized remote project approval, remote initiation, remote visits, remote administration and remote monitoring to get through two COVID-19 outbreaks in the capital city from February to April and June to July 2020. The effectiveness of measures was evaluated as differences in rates of protocol compliance, participants lost to follow-up, participant withdrawal, disease progression, participant mortality, and detection of monitoring problems. Results: During the late of the first outbreak, modifications were made in trial processing, participant management and quality control, which allowed the hospital to ensure the smooth conduct of 572 trials, with a protocol compliance rate of 85.24% for 3718 participants across both outbreaks. No COVID-19 infections were recorded among participants or trial staff, and no major procedural errors occurred between February and July 2020. These measures led to significantly higher rates of protocol compliance and significantly lower rates of loss to follow-up or withdrawal after the second outbreak than after the first, without affecting rates of disease progression or mortality. The hospital provided trial sponsors with a remote monitoring system in a timely manner, and 3820 trial issues were identified. Conclusions: When public health emergencies occur, an optimal clinical trial model combining on-site and remote management could guarantee the health care and treatment needs of clinical trial participants, in which remote management plays a key role.","[Fu, Zhiying; Jiang, Min; Wang, Kun; Li, Jian] Beijing Canc Hosp, Beijing Inst Canc Res, 52 Fucheng Rd, Beijing, Peoples R China","Li, J (corresponding author), Beijing Canc Hosp, Beijing Inst Canc Res, 52 Fucheng Rd, Beijing, Peoples R China.",LIJIAN8409@126.com,,,,,,25,0,0,0,0,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",TORONTO,"130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",1438-8871,,,J MED INTERNET RES,J.

Due to the emergency situation, regular and extensive screening of available and traditional drugs, which are commonly used for the treatment of similar viral diseases, can be a reasonable option. The present study aimed to compare the administration of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) plus arbidol to the use of HCQ alone in the treatment of COVID-19 infection. Methods and Materials: This single-blind randomized controlled trial was carried out on a total of 100 patients with COVID-19 referring to the infection ward of Imam Reza Hospital in Mashhad, Iran, in 2020. The patients were randomly assigned to two HCQ alone and HCQ plus arbidol groups. Results: According to the obtained results, hematological parameters, including white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, lymphocyte count, and platelet count, improved in patients with COVID-19 after the treatment with both HCQ plus arbidol and HCQ alone (P<0.005). The mean values of the reduction time of C-reactive protein (CRP) were 4.48 +/- 1.24 and 8.22 +/- 2.08 days in the arbidol and HCQ alone groups, respectively, indicating that CRP decreased faster in the arbidol group than that reported for the HCQ alone group (Z=0.-7.85; P<0.000). The mean scores of hospital stay were reported as 5.89 +/- 2.04 and 9.35 +/- 3.72 days in the arbidol and HCQ alone groups, respectively (Z=-4.31; P<0.005). All the patients in the arbidol group survived, while 6% of the subjects in the HCQ alone group died. In addition, the drug regimen was not changed for any patient, and no subject was transferred to the intensive care unit in the arbidol group. Conclusion: In summary, the administration of both arbidol and HCQ leads to the improvement of the hematological parameters. The present study introduced arbidol as an effective treatment for moderate to severe patients with COVID-19, which not only reduced the time of CRP normalization level but also decreased the hospitalization duration and mortality compared to those reported for HCQ.","[Khodashahi, Rozita; Naderi, Hamidreza; Bojdy, Amin; Heydari, Ali Akbar; Sani, Ashraf Tavanaee; Ghabouli, Mohammad Javad; Sarvghad, Mohammad Reza; Nateghi, Mahboubeh Haddad; Arian, Mahnaz; Jahanian, Shahrzad; Mazidi, Saeedeh; Pasand, Maziar Mortazavi] Mashhad Univ Med Sci, Fac Med, Dept Infect Dis & Trop Med, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran; [Hoseini, Binyamin] Mashhad Univ Med Sci, Pharmaceut Res Ctr, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran; [Dadgarmoghaddam, Maliheh] Mashhad Univ Med Sci, Fac Med, Community Med Dept, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran; [Khorsand, Ali] Mashhad Univ Med Sci, Dept Complementary & Chinese Med, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran; [Khodashahi, Mandana] Mashhad Univ Med Sci, Rheumat Dis Res Ctr, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran","Khodashahi, M (corresponding author), Mashhad Univ Med Sci, Rheumat Dis Res Ctr, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran.",Khodashahimn@mums.ac.ir,,,,,,37,0,0,0,0,BENTHAM SCIENCE PUBL LTD,SHARJAH,"EXECUTIVE STE Y-2, PO BOX 7917, SAIF ZONE, 1200 BR SHARJAH, U ARAB EMIRATES",1573-398X,1875-6387,,CURR RESPIR MED REV,Curr.

Limited data exist to guide the intensity of antithrombotic prophylaxis. Objective To evaluate the effects of intermediate-dose vs standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation among patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Design, Setting, and Participants Multicenter randomized trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design performed in 10 academic centers in Iran comparing intermediate-dose vs standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation (first hypothesis) and statin therapy vs matching placebo (second hypothesis; not reported in this article) among adult patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19. Patients were recruited between July 29, 2020, and November 19, 2020. The final follow-up date for the 30-day primary outcome was December 19, 2020. Interventions Intermediate-dose (enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg daily) (n = 276) vs standard prophylactic anticoagulation (enoxaparin, 40 mg daily) (n = 286), with modification according to body weight and creatinine clearance. The assigned treatments were planned to be continued until completion of 30-day follow-up. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or mortality within 30 days, assessed in randomized patients who met the eligibility criteria and received at least 1 dose of the assigned treatment. Prespecified safety outcomes included major bleeding according to the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (type 3 or 5 definition), powered for noninferiority (a noninferiority margin of 1.8 based on odds ratio), and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <20 x10(3)/mu L). All outcomes were blindly adjudicated. Results Among 600 randomized patients, 562 (93.7%) were included in the primary analysis (median [interquartile range] age, 62 [50-71] years; 237 [42.2%] women). The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 126 patients (45.7%) in the intermediate-dose group and 126 patients (44.1%) in the standard-dose prophylaxis group (absolute risk difference, 1.5% [95% CI, -6.6% to 9.8%]; odds ratio, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.76-1.48]; P = .70). Major bleeding occurred in 7 patients (2.5%) in the intermediate-dose group and 4 patients (1.4%) in the standard-dose prophylaxis group (risk difference, 1.1% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -infinity to 3.4%]; odds ratio, 1.83 [1-sided 97.5% CI, 0.00-5.93]), not meeting the noninferiority criteria (P for noninferiority >.99). Severe thrombocytopenia occurred only in patients assigned to the intermediate-dose group (6 vs 0 patients; risk difference, 2.2% [95% CI, 0.4%-3.8%]; P = .01). Conclusions and Relevance Among patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19, intermediate-dose prophylactic anticoagulation, compared with standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation, did not result in a significant difference in the primary outcome of a composite of adjudicated venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or mortality within 30 days. These results do not support the routine empirical use of intermediate-dose prophylactic anticoagulation in unselected patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19. Question What are the effects of intermediate-dose compared with standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU)? Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 562 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU, the primary outcome (a composite of adjudicated venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or mortality within 30 days) occurred in 45.7% of patients in the intermediate-dose prophylactic anticoagulation group and 44.1% of patients in the standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation group, a difference that was not statistically significant (odds ratio, 1.06). Meaning The results do not support routine empirical use of intermediate-dose prophylactic anticoagulation in unselected patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. This randomized trial compares the effect of intermediate-dose vs standard prophylactic enoxaparin on a composite outcome of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE), arterial thrombosis, need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and all-cause mortality within 30 days among patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU.","[Sadeghipour, Parham; Mohebbi, Bahram] Iran Univ Med Sci, Cardiovasc Intervent Res Ctr, Rajaie Cardiovasc Med & Res Ctr, Vali Asr Ave,Niyayesh Blvd, Tehran 1996911101, Iran; [Sadeghipour, Parham; Bakhshandeh, Hooman] Iran Univ Med Sci, Clin Trial Ctr, Rajaie Cardiovasc Med & Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Talasaz, Azita H.; Hajighasemi, Alireza; Sadeghian, Saeed] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Tehran Heart Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Rashidi, Farid; Rezaeifar, Parisa; Tahamtan, Ouria; Matin, Samira] TB & Lung Dis Res Ctr, Tabriz, Iran; [Sharif-Kashani, Babak] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Natl Res Inst TB & Lung Dis NRITLD, Tobacoo Prevent & Control Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Sharif-Kashani, Babak; Shafaghi, Shadi] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Natl Res Inst TB & Lung Dis NRITLD, Dept Cardiol, Lung Transplantat Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Beigmohammadi, Mohammad Taghi; Ghazi, Samrand Fattah] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Imam Khomeini Hosp Complex, Anesthesiol & Intens Care, Tehran, Iran; [Farrokhpour, Mohsen; Yadollahzadeh, Mahdi; Sadeghipour, Pardis; Abri, Homa] Iran Univ Med Sci, Firouzgar Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Tehran, Iran; [Sezavar, Seyed Hashem] Iran Univ Med Sci, Inst Endocrinol & Metab, Res Ctr Prevent Cardiovasc Dis, Tehran, Iran; [Payandemehr, Pooya; Shahmirzaei, Shaghayegh; Najafi, Atabak] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sina Hosp, Tehran, Iran; [Dabbagh, Ali] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Sch Med Anesthesiol, Dept Anesthesiol, Res Ctr,Shahid Modarres Hosp, Tehran, Iran; [Moghadam, Keivan Gohari] Shariati Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Tehran, Iran; [Jamalkhani, Sepehr] Iran Univ Med Sci, Student Res Comm, Tehran, Iran; [Khalili, Hossein] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Imam Khomeini Hosp Complex, Dept Pharmacotherapy, Tehran, Iran; [Riahi, Taghi; Tabrizi, Sanaz; Mousavian, Seyed Masoud] Iran Univ Med Sci, Rasoul e Akram Hosp, Tehran, Iran; [Abedini, Atefeh; Lookzadeh, Somayeh] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Masih Daneshvari Hosp, Chron Resp Dis Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Rahmani, Hamid] Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Dept Pharmacotherapy, Fac Pharm, Kermanshah, Iran; [Zoghi, Elnaz; Mohammadi, Keyhan; Kakavand, Hessam; Hosseini, Seyed Hossein] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Pharm, Tehran, Iran; [Bakhshandeh, Hooman; Amin, Ahmad; Rafiee, Farnaz; Baghizadeh, Elahe; Parhizgar, Seyed Ehsan; Hadavand, Naser; Maleki, Majid] Iran Univ Med Sci, Rajaie Cardiovasc Med & Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Aliannejad, Rasoul] Shariati Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Pulm & Crit Care, Tehran, Iran; [Aliannejad, Rasoul] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Adv Thorac Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Eslami, Vahid] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Kashefizadeh, Alireza] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Shahid Dr Labbafinejad Hosp, Tehran, Iran; [Jimenez, David] Hosp Ramon y Cajal IRYCIS, Resp Dept, Madrid, Spain; [Jimenez, David] Univ Alcala IRYCIS, Med Dept, Madrid, Spain; [Jimenez, David] CIBER Enfermedades Resp CIBERES, Madrid, Spain; [Gupta, Aakriti; Madhavan, Mahesh V.; Sethi, Sanjum S.; Parikh, Sahil A.; Kirtane, Ajay J.; Stone, Gregg W.; Bikdeli, Behnood] Cardiovasc Res Fdn CRF, New York, NY USA; [Gupta, Aakriti; Madhavan, Mahesh V.; Sethi, Sanjum S.; Parikh, Sahil A.; Kirtane, Ajay J.] Columbia Univ, Irving Med Ctr, NewYork Presbyterian Hosp, Div Cardiol, New York, NY USA; [Gupta, Aakriti; Krumholz, Harlan M.; Bikdeli, Behnood] Yale YNHH Ctr Outcomes Res & Evaluat, New Haven, CT USA; [Monreal, Manuel] Hosp Badalona Germans Trias & Pujol, Dept Internal Med, Barcelona, Spain; [Monreal, Manuel] Univ Catolica Murcia, Murcia, Spain; [Piazza, Gregory; Goldhaber, Samuel Z.; Bikdeli, Behnood] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Cardiovasc Med Div, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Van Tassell, Benjamin W.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmacotherapy & Outcome Sci, Richmond, VA USA; [Van Tassell, Benjamin W.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Sch Pharm, Dept Internal Med, Pauley Heart Ctr,Div Cardiol, Richmond, VA USA; [Dobesh, Paul P.] Univ Nebraska Med Ctr, Coll Pharm, Omaha, NE USA; [Stone, Gregg W.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Zena & Michael A Wiener Cardiovasc Inst, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Lip, Gregory Y.

Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the reasons why health care workers chose to participate in the MeCOVID and EPICOS trials, as well as why they chose one over the other. Methods: Both trials were offered to health care workers through an internal news bulletin. After an initial screening visit, all subjects were asked to respond to a web-based survey. Results: In the first month, 206 health care workers were screened and 160 were randomized. The survey participation was high at 73.3%. Health care workers cited to contribute to scientific knowledge (n=80, 53.0%), followed by to avoid SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=33, 21.9%) and the interest to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 (n=28, 18.5%), as their primary reasons to participate in the trials. We observed significant differences in the expected personal benefits across physicians and nurses (P=.01). The vast majority of volunteers (n=202, 98.0%) selected the MeCOVID trial, their primary reason being their concern regarding adverse reactions to treatments in the EPICOS trial (n=102, 69.4%). Conclusions: Health care workers' reasons to participate in prophylaxis trials in an acute pandemic context appear to be driven largely by their desire to contribute to science and to gain health benefits. Safety outweighed efficacy when choosing between the two clinical trials.","[Borobia, Alberto M.; Garcia-Garcia, Irene; Diaz-Garcia, Lucia; Rodriguez-Mariblanca, Amelia; Martinez de Soto, Lucia; Monserrat Villatoro, Jaime; Seco Meseguer, Enrique; Frias Iniesta, Jesus; Ramirez Garcia, Elena; Carcas-Sansuan, Antonio J.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, La Paz Univ Hosp IdiPAZ, Sch Med, Clin Pharmacol Dept, Paseo Castellana 261, Madrid 28046, Spain; [Gonzalez, Juan J.; Ramon Arribas, Jose] Univ Autonoma Madrid, La Paz Univ Hosp IdiPAZ, Sch Med, Internal Med Dept, Madrid, Spain","Borobia, AM (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, La Paz Univ Hosp IdiPAZ, Sch Med, Clin Pharmacol Dept, Paseo Castellana 261, Madrid 28046, Spain.",alberto.borobia@idipaz.es,"; Borobia, Alberto M./H-6887-2013; Ramirez, Elena/S-5600-2018","Roman, Raul/0000-0001-6803-191X; Borobia, Alberto M./0000-0002-8584-3263; Ramirez, Elena/0000-0002-4052-8876; Martinez de Soto, Lucia/0000-0002-2941-0922",,,,11,0,0,1,1,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",TORONTO,"130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",1438-8871,,,J MED INTERNET RES,J.

Hydroxychloroquine has been proposed as a postexposure therapy to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), but definitive evidence is lacking. MethodsWe conducted an open-label, cluster-randomized trial involving asymptomatic contacts of patients with polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR)-confirmed Covid-19 in Catalonia, Spain. We randomly assigned clusters of contacts to the hydroxychloroquine group (which received the drug at a dose of 800 mg once, followed by 400 mg daily for 6 days) or to the usual-care group (which received no specific therapy). The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 within 14 days. The secondary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined by symptoms compatible with Covid-19 or a positive PCR test regardless of symptoms. Adverse events were assessed for up to 28 days. ResultsThe analysis included 2314 healthy contacts of 672 index case patients with Covid-19 who were identified between March 17 and April 28, 2020. A total of 1116 contacts were randomly assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine and 1198 to receive usual care. Results were similar in the hydroxychloroquine and usual-care groups with respect to the incidence of PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 (5.7% and 6.2%, respectively; risk ratio, 0.86 [95% confidence interval, 0.52 to 1.42]). In addition, hydroxychloroquine was not associated with a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission than usual care (18.7% and 17.8%, respectively). The incidence of adverse events was higher in the hydroxychloroquine group than in the usual-care group (56.1% vs. 5.9%), but no treatment-related serious adverse events were reported. ConclusionsPostexposure therapy with hydroxychloroquine did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or symptomatic Covid-19 in healthy persons exposed to a PCR-positive case patient. (Funded by the crowdfunding campaign YoMeCorono and others; BCN-PEP-CoV2 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04304053.) In a trial involving asymptomatic contacts of patients with PCR-confirmed Covid-19 in Spain, the authors compared the use of hydroxychloroquine with usual care. Postexposure therapy with hydroxychloroquine did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or symptomatic Covid-19 in healthy persons.","[Mitja, Oriol; Corbacho-Monne, Marc; Ubals, Maria; Alemany, Andrea; Suner, Clara; Ballana, Ester; Perez, Carla A.; Admella, Pol; Riera-Marti, Nuria; Laporte, Pep; Mitja, Jordi; Clua, Mireia; Bertran, Laia; Sarquella, Maria; Gavilan, Sergi; Nieto, Aroa; Puig, Jordi; Ramirez-Viaplana, Ferran; Sierra, Alba; Vall-Mayans, Marti; Gonzalez-Beiras, Camila; Clotet, Bonaventura] Fight AIDS & Infect Dis Fdn, Washington, DC USA; [Mitja, Oriol; Ara, Jordi; Farre, Magi; Quinones, Carles; Vall-Mayans, Marti; Clotet, Bonaventura] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Hosp Univ Germans Trias & Pujol, Barcelona, Spain; [Ballana, Ester; Elizalde-Torrent, Aleix; Riveira-Munoz, Eva; Ruiz, Lidia] Germans Trias & Pujol Res Inst, IrsiCaixa AIDS Res Inst, Barcelona, Spain; [Muntada, Esteve; Reyes-Uruena, Juliana; Sentis, Alexis] Generalitat Catalunya, Ctr Epidemiol Studies HIV AIDS & STI Catalonia, Catalan Inst Oncol, Dept Salut, Badalona, Spain; [Corbacho-Monne, Marc; Ubals, Maria] Univ Barcelona, Fac Med, Barcelona, Spain; [Tobias, Aurelio] Spanish Council Sci Res, Inst Environm Assessment & Water Res, Madrid, Spain; [Argimon, Josep M.; Casabona, Jordi] Inst Catala Salut, Direccio Gerencia, Barcelona, Spain; [Cuatrecasas, Gabriel] Synlab Diagnost, Equip Atencio Primaria Sarria, Barcelona, Spain; [Fabregat, Robert] Generalitat Catalunya, Direccio Gen Recerca & Innovacio Salut, Barcelona, Spain; [Lopez, Cristina; Zamora, Juani] TFS Clin Contract Res Org, Barcelona, Spain; [Nadal, Nuria] Inst Catala Salut, Gerencia Terr Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Sanz, Sergi] Univ Barcelona, ISGlobal, Hosp Clin, Barcelona, Spain; [Velasco, Cesar; Vivanco-Hidalgo, Rosa M.] Agencia Qualitat & Avaluacio Sanitaries Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain; [Tebe, Cristian; Penafiel, Judith] Bellvitge Biomed Res Inst, Lhospitalet De Llobregat, Spain; [Forcada, Anna] Inst Catala Salut, Gerencia Terr Catalunya Cent, St Fruitos De Bages, Spain; [Flores-Mateo, Gemma] Xarxa Santa Tecla Sanitaria & Social, Tarragona, Spain; [Narejos, Silvia] Entitat Base Asociat Centelles Atencio Primaria, Centelles, Spain; [Prat, Nuria] Inst Catala Salut, Gerencia Terr Ambit Metropolita Nord, Sabadell, Spain; [Casabona, Jordi] Ctr Invest Biomed Red Epidemiol & Salud Publ, Madrid, Spain; [Mitja, Oriol; Clotet, Bonaventura] Univ Cent Catalunya, Univ Vic, Vic, Spain; [Mitja, Oriol] Int SOS, Lihir Med Ctr, Lihir Isl, Papua N Guinea","Mitja, O (corresponding author), Hosp Badalona Germans Trias & Pujol, Carretera Canyet S-N, Badalona 08916, Spain.",omitja@flsida.org,,"Mateu, Lourdes/0000-0001-7223-7611; Sentis, Alexis/0000-0002-8132-5645; Corbacho-Monne, Marc/0000-0001-8675-2868; Bolivar Prados, Mireia/0000-0002-8896-1150; Flores-Mateo, Gemma/0000-0001-6901-7327; Riera-Marti, Nuria/0000-0002-0876-7527",crowdfunding campaign YoMeCorono; Generalitat de CatalunyaGeneralitat de Catalunya; Zurich Seguros; Synlab Diagnosticos; Laboratorios Rubio; Laboratorios Gebro Pharma,"Supported by the crowdfunding campaign YoMeCorono (www.yomecorono.com/), Generalitat de Catalunya, Zurich Seguros, Synlab Diagnosticos, Laboratorios Rubio, and Laboratorios Gebro Pharma.

This trial aims to evaluate sofosbuvir and daclatasvir versus standard care for outpatients with mild COVID-19 infection. Methods: This was a randomized controlled clinical trial in outpatients with mild COVID-19. Patients were randomized into a treatment arm receiving sofosbuvir/daclatasvir plus hydroxychloroquine or a control arm receiving hydroxychloroquine alone. The primary endpoint of the trial was symptom alleviation after 7 days of follow-up. The secondary endpoint of the trial was hospital admission. Fatigue, dyspnoea and loss of appetite were investigated after 1 month of follow-up. This study is registered with the IRCT.ir under registration number IRCT20200403046926N1. Results: Between 8 April 2020 and 19 May 2020, 55 patients were recruited and allocated to either the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir treatment arm (n = 27) or the control arm (n = 28). Baseline characteristics were similar across treatment arms. There was no significant difference in symptoms at Day 7. One patient was admitted to hospital in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir arm and four in the control arm, but the difference was not significant. After 1 month of follow-up, two patients reported fatigue in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir arm and 16 in the control arm; P < 0.001. Conclusions: In this study, sofosbuvir/daclatasvir did not significantly alleviate symptoms after 7 days of treatment compared with control. Although fewer hospitalizations were observed in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir arm, this was not statistically significant. Sofosbuvir/daclatasvir significantly reduced the number of patients with fatigue and dyspnoea after 1 month. Larger, well-designed trials are warranted.","[Roozbeh, Fatemeh] Mazandaran Univ Med Sci, Sari, Iran; [Saeedi, Majid] Mazandaran Univ Med Sci, Pharmaceut Sci Res Ctr, Sari, Iran; [Alizadeh-Navaei, Reza; Hedayatizadeh-Omran, Akbar; Shamshirian, Amir] Mazandaran Univ Med Sci, Gastrointestinal Canc Res Ctr, Noncommunicable Dis Inst, Sari, Iran; [Merat, Shahin] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Liver & Pancreatobiliary Dis Res Ctr, Digest Dis Res Inst, Tehran, Iran; [Wentzel, Hannah] Imperial Coll London, Sch Publ Hlth, London, England; [Levi, Jacob] Homerton Univ Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, London, England; [Hill, Andrew] Univ Liverpool, Dept Pharmacol & Therapeut, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Shamshirian, Amir] Mazandaran Univ Med Sci, Sch Allied Med Sci, Dept Med Lab Sci, Sari, Iran","Shamshirian, A (corresponding author), Mazandaran Univ Med Sci, Gastrointestinal Canc Res Ctr, Noncommunicable Dis Inst, Sari, Iran.; Shamshirian, A (corresponding author), Mazandaran Univ Med Sci, Sch Allied Med Sci, Dept Med Lab Sci, Sari, Iran.",shamshirian.amir@gmail.com,,,Vice-Chancellor for Research at Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences,This study was supported by the Vice-Chancellor for Research at Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.,,26,1,1,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-7453,1460-2091,,J ANTIMICROB CHEMOTH,J.

Polyclonal neutralizing antibodies offers many advantages such as providing immediate immunity, consequently blunting an early pro-inflammatory pathogenic endogenous antibody response and lack of drug-drug interactions.By providing immediate immunity and inhibiting entry into cells, neutralizing antibody treatment is of interest for patient with COVID-19-induced moderate pneumonia. Convalescent plasma to treat infected patients is therefore a relevant therapeutic option currently under assessment (CORIMUNO-PLASM NCT04324047). However, the difficulties of collecting plasma on the long term are not adapted to a broad use across all populations.New polyclonal humanized anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies (XAV-19) developed by Xenothera and administered intravenous. XAV-19 is a heterologous swine glyco-humanized polyclonal antibody (GH-pAb) raised against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, blocking infection of ACE-2-positive human cells with SARS-CoV-2.MethodsPharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies have been performed in preclinical models including primates. A first human study with another fully representative GH-pAb from Xenothera is ongoing in recipients of a kidney graft. These studies indicated that 5 consecutive administrations of GH-pAbs can be safely performed in humans.The objectives of this 2-step phase 2 randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled study are to define the safety and the optimal XAV-19 dose to administrate to patients with SARS-CoV-2 induced moderate pneumonia, and to assess the clinical benefits of a selected dose of XAV-19 in this population.DiscussionThis study will determine the clinical benefits of XAV-19 when administered to patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced moderate pneumonia. As a prerequisite, a first step of the study will define the safety and the dose of XAV-19 to be used.Such treatment might become a new therapeutic option to provide an effective treatment for COVID-19 patients (possibly in combination with anti-viral and immunotherapies). Further studies could later evaluate such passive immunotherapy as a potential post-exposure prophylaxis.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT04453384, registered on 1 July 2020, and EUDRACT 2020-002574-27, registered 6 June 2020.","[Gaborit, Benjamin; Orain, Jeremie; Le Bras, Morgane; Morineau-Le Houssine, Pascale; Raffi, Francois] CHU Nantes, Dept Infect Dis, Clin Invest, Nantes, France; [Gaborit, Benjamin; Ferre, Virginie; Orain, Jeremie; Le Bras, Morgane; Morineau-Le Houssine, Pascale; Poinas, Alexandra; Raffi, Francois] CHU Nantes, Nantes, France; [Gaborit, Benjamin; Ferre, Virginie; Orain, Jeremie; Le Bras, Morgane; Morineau-Le Houssine, Pascale; Poinas, Alexandra; Raffi, Francois] INSERM, Clin Invest Ctr CIC1413, Nantes, France; [Vanhove, Bernard; Duvaux, Odile] Xenothera, Nantes, France; [Vibet, Marie-Anne; Le Thuaut, Aurelie; Omnes, Anne; Berly, Laetitia; Jobert, Alexandra] CHU Nantes, Sponsor Dept, Nantes, France; [Lacombe, Karine] Sorbonne Univ, Hop St Antoine, AP HP, Inst Pierre Louis Epidemiol & Sante Publ,Serv Mal, Paris, France; [Dubee, Vincent] CHU Angers, Serv Malad Infect & Trop, Angers, France; [Ader, Florence] Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, Ctr Int Rech Infectiol CIRI, Ecole Normale Super Lyon,CNRS,UMR5308,INSERM, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Ader, Florence] Hosp Civils Lyon, Dept Malad Infect & Trop, F-69004 Lyon, France; [Ferre, Virginie] CHU Nantes, Virol Lab, Nantes, France; [Vicaut, Eric] Univ Paris Diderot, Fernand Widal Hosp, AP HP, Sorbonne Paris Cite,Dept Biostat, Paris, France; [Botturi, Karine] CHU Nantes, Partnership & Innovat Dept, Nantes, France; [Josien, Regis; Degauque, Nicolas; Brouard, Sophie] Nantes Univ, CHU Nantes, INSERM, Ctr Rech Transplantat & Immunol,ITUN,UMR 1064, F-44000 Nantes, France; [Josien, Regis] CHU Nantes, Lab Immunol, Nantes, France; [Flet, Laurent] CHU Nantes, Pharm Dept, Nantes, France; [Degauque, Nicolas; Brouard, Sophie] Nantes Univ, CHU Nantes, Inst Transplantat Urol Nephrol ITUN, Nantes, France","Poinas, A (corresponding author), CHU Nantes, Nantes, France.; Poinas, A (corresponding author), INSERM, Clin Invest Ctr CIC1413, Nantes, France.",Alexandra.poinas@chu-nantes.fr,,,Public Investment Bank,"YYY This study is supported by Public Investment Bank, also known as BPI France in the framework of the Investment for the Futur programme (Programme d'Investissements d'Avenir).

Nurses who work with COVID-19 patients are particularly vulnerable to emotions such as fear and anxiety, due to fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness related to their high intensity work. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of a brief online form of Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) in the prevention of stress, anxiety, and burnout in nurses involved in the treatment of COVID patients. Methods: The study is a randomized controlled trial. It complies with the guidelines prescribed by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist. It was conducted in a COVID-19 department at a university hospital in Turkey. We recruited nurses who care for patients infected with COVID-19 and randomly allocated them into an intervention group (n = 35) and a no-treatment control group (n = 37). The intervention group received one guided online group EFT session. Results: Reductions in stress (p < .001), anxiety (p < .001), and burnout (p < .001) reached high levels of statistical significance for the intervention group. The control group showed no statistically significant changes on these measures (p > .05).

Methods: A prospective, randomized, controlled trial was conducted among patients with post COVID-19 anosmia. One hundred patients were randomly assigned to two groups; group I included 50 patients received mometasone furoate nasal spray in an appropriate dose of 2 puff (100 ktg) once daily in each nostril for 3 weeks with olfactory training, group II included 50 patients were advised to keep on olfactory training only. The assessment of smell was done using (Visual Analog Scale from 0 to 10). All patients were initially evaluated after their recovery from COVID-19 and followed up for 3 weeks. The smell scores were recorded weekly and the duration of smell loss was recorded from the onset of anosmia till the full recovery. Results: In both groups, the smell scores significantly improved by the end of the third week (P < 0.001). By comparing smell scores between both groups after 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks of treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between both groups. In group I, (62%) of patients completely recovered their sense of smell after 3 weeks of treatment, compared to (52%) of patients in group II (P = 0.31).

TMPRSS2 is regulated by the androgen receptor, hence, SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is indirectly dependent on androgenic status and phenotype. Previously, we have reported that men affected by androgenetic alopecia (AGA) are overrepresented in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Additionally, we have reported that men taking antiandrogenic drugs, e.g., 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARis), are less likely to have severe COVID-19. Here we aimed to test whether the androgen receptor antagonist, Proxalutamide, would be a beneficial treatment for subjects with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods Male and female subjects were recruited to a double-blinded, randomized, prospective, investigational study of Proxalutamide for the treatment of COVID-19. Mild to moderate, non-hospitalized subjects, who were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2, were treated with either Proxalutamide 200 mg/day or placebo. Endpoints for the study were remission lime (days) and the percentage of subjects confirmed negative for SARS-CoV-2 on Day 7 after treatment. A negative SARS-CoV-2 lest was defined by concentration-time (Ct)>40 determined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR). Results Two-hundred thirty-six (2360 subjects were included in the study (108 female, 128 male); 171 were randomized to the Proxalutamide arm and 65 were in the placebo group. On Day 7, SARS-CoV-2 became non-detectable with rtPCR (cT>40) in 82% of the subjects in the Proxalutamide group versus 31% in the placebo group (p < 0.001). The average clinical remission time for patients treated with Proxalutamide was 4.2 +/- 5.4 days versus 21.8 +/- 13.0 days in the placebo arm (p < 0.001). Conclusion Proxalutamide significantly accelerated viral clearance on Day 7 in mild to moderate COVID-19 patients versus placebo. Further, the time to clinical remission was significantly reduced in patients treated with Proxalutamide versus placebo.","[Cadegiani, Flavio A.] Appl Biol Inc, Internal Med Diabet & Endocrinol, Irvine, CA USA; [Cadegiani, Flavio A.] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Clin Endocrinol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [McCoy, John] Appl Biol Inc, Res & Dev, Irvine, CA 92614 USA; [Wambier, Carlos Gustavo] Brown Univ, Alpert Med Sch, Dermatol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Vano-Galvan, Sergio] Ramon & Cajal Hosp, Dermatol, Madrid, Spain; [Shapiro, Jerry] NYU, Ronald O Perelman Dept Dermatol, New York, NY USA; [Tosti, Antonella] Univ Miami Hlth Syst, Dermatol, Miami, FL USA; [Zimerman, Ricardo A.] Hosp Brigada Mil, Infect Dis, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Goren, Andy] Appl Biol Inc, Dermatol, Irvine, CA USA","McCoy, J (corresponding author), Appl Biol Inc, Res & Dev, Irvine, CA 92614 USA.",johnm@appliedbiology.com,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,CUREUS INC,PALO ALTO,"PO BOX 61002, PALO ALTO, CA 94306 USA",,2168-8184,,CUREUS,Cureus,FEB 22,2021,13,2,,,,,,,e13492,10.7759/cureus.13492,,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,QL4CZ,WOS:000621027200014,33633920,"Other Gold, Green Published",,,2021-03-31,

Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive technology that may provide effective behavioral therapeutics for chronic pain. Objective: We aimed to conduct a double-blind, parallel-arm, single-cohort, remote, randomized placebo-controlled trial for a self-administered behavioral skills-based VR program in community-based individuals with self-reported chronic low back pain during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A national online convenience sample of individuals with self-reported nonmalignant low back pain with duration of 6 months or more and with average pain intensity of 4 or more/10 was enrolled and randomized 1:1 to 1 of 2 daily (56-day) VR programs: (1) EaseVRx (immersive pain relief skills VR program); or (2) Sham VR (2D nature content delivered in a VR headset). Objective device use data and self-reported data were collected. The primary outcomes were the between-group effect of EaseVRx versus Sham VR across time points, and the between-within interaction effect representing the change in average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, stress, mood, and sleep over time (baseline to end-of-treatment at day 56). Secondary outcomes were global impression of change and change in physical function, sleep disturbance, pain self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, pain acceptance, pain medication use, and user satisfaction. Analytic methods included intention-to-treat and a mixed-model framework. Results: The study sample was 179 adults (female: 76.5%, 137/179; Caucasian: 90.5%, 162/179; at least some college education: 91.1%, 163/179; mean age: 51.5 years [SD 13.1]; average pain intensity: 5/10 [SD 1.2]; back pain duration >= 5 years: 67%, 120/179). No group differences were found for any baseline variable or treatment engagement. User satisfaction ratings were higher for EaseVRx versus Sham VR (P<. 001). For the between-groups factor, EaseVRx was superior to Sham VR for all primary outcomes (highest P value=.009), and between-groups Cohen d effect sizes ranged from 0.40 to 0.49, indicating superiority was moderately clinically meaningful. For EaseVRx, large pre-post effect sizes ranged from 1.17 to 1.3 and met moderate to substantial clinical importance for reduced pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, mood, and stress. Between-group comparisons for Physical Function and Sleep Disturbance showed superiority for the EaseVRx group versus the Sham VR group (P=.022 and .013, respectively). Pain catastrophizing, pain self-efficacy, pain acceptance, prescription opioid use (morphine milligram equivalent) did not reach statistical significance for either group. Use of over-the-counter analgesic use was reduced for EaseVRx (P<.01) but not for Sham VR. Conclusions: EaseVRx had high user satisfaction and superior and clinically meaningful symptom reduction for average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, mood, and stress compared to sham VR. Additional research is needed to determine durability of treatment effects and to characterize mechanisms of treatment effects. Home-based VR may expand access to effective and on-demand nonpharmacologic treatment for chronic low back pain.","[Garcia, Laura M.; Birckhead, Brandon J.; Sackman, Josh; Mackey, Ian G.; Maddox, Todd] AppliedVR Inc, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Krishnamurthy, Parthasarathy] Univ Houston, CT Bauer Coll Business, Houston, TX USA; [Louis, Robert G.] Hoag Mem Hosp, Pickup Family Neurosci Inst, Div Neurosurg, Newport Beach, CA USA; [Salmasi, Vafi; Darnall, Beth D.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, 1070 Arastradero Rd,Ste 200,MC5596, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA","Darnall, BD (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, 1070 Arastradero Rd,Ste 200,MC5596, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA.",bdarnall@stanford.edu,,"Salmasi, Vafi/0000-0002-1288-4531; Birckhead, Brandon/0000-0002-5822-7318; Darnall, Beth D./0000-0003-3590-511X","AppliedVR, Inc","AppliedVR, Inc supported this study.",,78,0,0,3,3,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",TORONTO,"130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",1438-8871,,,J MED INTERNET RES,J.

Nowadays, aerosol box is used in conjunction with WHO-recommended safety kits, to avoid health workers from getting SARS-CoV-2 infection during aerosol-generating procedures. In our study, we compared the ease of oral intubation with C-MAC video laryngoscope and direct laryngoscopy, when the aerosol box was used. The secondary objectives were to compare the incidence of airway loss, haemodynamic changes, number of attempts, and time required for intubation between these two techniques. Methods: This prospective randomised controlled study was conducted on 60 non-coronavirus disease (COVID) patients presenting for elective surgery under general anaesthesia. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups:C and D using a computer-generated random sequence of numbers by closed envelope technique. In group D, laryngoscopy was performed with Macintosh blade and in group C, with Storz (R) C-MAC video laryngoscope. Results: The ease of intubation was better (grade 1) in group C than D (68.6% vs. 31.4% respectively) with a P value of <0.001. 10% of patients required more than one intubation attempt in group D compared to none in group C, but this difference was not statistically significant. The intubation time was comparable between the two groups. There were no incidences of loss of airway or failure to intubate in both groups. Conclusion: The use of C-MAC video-laryngoscopy resulted in easier orotracheal intubation as compared to intubation with direct laryngoscopy when the aerosol box was used.","[Puthenveettil, Nitu; Rahman, Sajan; Vijayaraghavan, Sundeep; Suresh, Sneha; Kadapamannil, Dilesh; Paul, Jerry] Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amrita Inst Med Sci, Dept Plast Surg, Dept Anaesthesia & Crit Care, Kochi, Kerala, India","Vijayaraghavan, S (corresponding author), Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amrita Inst Med Sci, Dept Plast Surg, Kochi 682041, Kerala, India.",veesundeep@gmail.com,,,,,,21,0,0,0,0,WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS,MUMBAI,"WOLTERS KLUWER INDIA PVT LTD , A-202, 2ND FLR, QUBE, C T S  NO 1498A-2 VILLAGE MAROL, ANDHERI EAST, MUMBAI, 400059, INDIA",0019-5049,0976-2817,,INDIAN J ANAESTH,Indian J.

Given the profound inflammatory response observed in patients with COVID-19, and the successful completion of 10-patient pilot study of intravenous hAF, we present a trial design for a larger clinical trial of intravenous hAF for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods and analysis This paper describes the methodology of a phase I/II randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine the safety and feasibility of using acellular sterile filtered amniotic fluid as a treatment for patients with COVID-19. Primary outcome will be the change in C-reactive protein. Secondary outcomes include safety, biomarker inflammatory levels and clinically relevant outcomes at 30 days, including mortality, ventilator-free days and hospital and intensive care unit length of stay. Exploratory outcomes of health-related quality-of-life patient-reported outcomes will be collected. Hospitalised patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 will be recruited.

Areas covered: The results of nocebo effects in RCT placebo groups, measured in terms of adverse events (AEs) and dropouts, will be presented as an explicative framework for the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are the only RCTs routinely conducted during the pandemic. Information about efficacy and safety of different vaccines represents a fertile ground for nocebo phenomena. Individual and contextual factors will be emphasized in order to understand the presence of a refusal of immunization associated with a specific vaccine considered less effective and safe. Critical aspects and some guidelines will be presented in order to counteract the nocebo effects and to improve adherence to drug treatments and the vaccination campaign. Expert opinion: The nocebo effect could explain the presence of strong resistance in European countries to immunization with a vaccine perceived as less effective, compared to others. Increased awareness of the nocebo effect would be relevant as it could lead to a greater participation in the vaccination campaign and in protecting individuals against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","[Amanzio, Martina; Cipriani, Giuseppina Elena; Bartoli, And Massimo] Univ Turin, Dept Psychol, Turin, Italy","Amanzio, M (corresponding author), Univ Turin, Dept Psychol, Turin, Italy.",martina.amanzio@unito.it,"Amanzio, Martina/A-9085-2010","Amanzio, Martina/0000-0002-2504-032X; Bartoli, Massimo/0000-0002-8950-3602; Cipriani, Giuseppina Elena/0000-0002-8427-9293",,,,48,0,0,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2433,1751-2441,,EXPERT REV CLIN PHAR,Expert Rev.

We investigated the influence of personal protective equipment on out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Methods: Randomised controlled non-inferiority triple-crossover study. Forty-eight emergency medical service providers, randomized into teams of two, performed 12 min of basic life support (BLS) on a manikin after climbing 3 flights of stairs. Three scenarios were completed in a randomised order: Without personal protective equipment, with personal protective equipment including a filtering face piece (FFP) 2 mask with valve, and with personal protective equipment including an FFP2 mask without valve. The primary outcome was mean depth of chest compressions with a pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 3.5 mm. Secondary outcomes included other measurements of CPR quality, providers' subjective exhaustion levels, and providers' vital signs, including end-tidal CO2. Results: Differences regarding the primary outcome were well below the pre-defined non-inferiority margins for both control vs. personal protective equipment without valve (absolute difference 1 mm, 95% CI [-1, 2]) and control vs. personal protective equipment with valve (absolute difference 1 mm, [-0.2, 2]). This was also true for secondary outcomes regarding quality of chest compressions and providers' vital signs including etCO(2). Subjective physical strain after BLS was higher in the personal protective equipment groups (Borg 4 (SD 3) without valve, 4 (SD 2) with valve) than in the control group (Borg 3 (SD 2)). Conclusion: PPE including masks with and without expiration valve is safe for use without concerns regarding the impairment of CPR quality.","[Kienbacher, Calvin Lukas; Grafeneder, Jurgen; Tscherny, Katharina; Fuhrmann, Verena; Niederer, Maximilian; Schreiber, Wolfgang; Herkner, Harald; Roth, Dominik] Med Univ Vienna, Dept Emergency Med, Wahringer Gurtel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Krammel, Mario; Neudorfsky, Sabine; Herbich, Klaus] Emergency Med Serv Vienna, Radetzkystr 1, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Krammel, Mario; Schreiber, Wolfgang] Austrian Cardiac Arrest Awareness Assoc, PULS, Lichtentaler Gasse 4-1-R03, A-1090 Vienna, Austria","Herkner, H (corresponding author), Med Univ Vienna, Dept Emergency Med, Wahringer Gurtel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",harald.herkner@meduniwien.ac.at,,"Grafeneder, Juergen/0000-0002-3639-0106",Emergency Medical Service Vienna (Berufsrettung Wien); Medical Scientific Fund of the Mayor of the City of Vienna [COVID054],"We would like to thank the Emergency Medical Service Vienna (Berufsrettung Wien) for providing extensive knowledge and practical support to the project, as well as for providing personnel.

COVID-19-related ARDS is subject to a mortality rate of 50% and prolonged period of mechanical ventilation, with no specific pharmacological treatment currently available (Infection au nouveau Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19, France et Monde. https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/dossiers/coronavirus covid 19). Because of its immunomodulatory action, we propose to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration in patients developing COVID-19-related ARDS. Methods: The trial is a phase III double-blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel group, concurrent, controlled study in hospitalized participants with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation using a sequential design. Participants in the treatment group will receive infusions of polyvalent immunoglobulin for 4 consecutive days, and the placebo group will receive an equivalent volume of sodium chloride 0.9% for the same duration. The primary outcome is the number of ventilator-free days up to the 28th day. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of MG on (1) organ failure according to the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at 14 and 28 days, (2) lung injury score at 14 and 28 days, (3) the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events of MG, (4) length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, (5) length of hospital stay, (6) functional outcomes at day 90 defined by the activities of daily living and instrumental activities of the daily living scales, and (7) 90-day survival. One hundred thirty-eight subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to MG or placebo groups (69 in each group), considering 90% power, alpha level 0.05 (two sides), and 0.67 effect size level. Discussion: The ICAR trial investigates the effect of MG in COVID-19-related ARDS. We expect an increase in the survival rate and a reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation, which is associated with significant morbidity.","[Mazeraud, Aurelien; Goncalves, Bruno; Mancusi, Letizia; Rieu, Christine; Sylla, Khaoussou; Sharshar, Tarek] GHU Paris Psychiat & Neurosci, Serv Neuroanesthesie Neuroreanimat, Paris, France; [Mazeraud, Aurelien; Sharshar, Tarek] Univ Paris, Paris, France; [Goncalves, Bruno; Bozza, Fernando] Inst Estadual Cerebro Paulo Niemeyer, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Aegerter, Philippe] GIRCI IDF, Cellule Methodol, Paris, France; [Aegerter, Philippe] Univ Paris Saclay, Equipe Epidemiol Resp Integrat, CESP Ctr Rech Epidemiol & Sante Populat, UVSQ,Inserm,U1018,INSERM,UPS,UVSQ, Villejuif, France; [Siami, Shidasp] CH Sud Essonnes, Serv Reanimat, Etampes, France","Mazeraud, A (corresponding author), GHU Paris Psychiat & Neurosci, Serv Neuroanesthesie Neuroreanimat, Paris, France.; Mazeraud, A (corresponding author), Univ Paris, Paris, France.",a.mazeraud@ghu-paris.fr,,"AEGERTER, Philippe/0000-0002-9156-5028",Programme Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique; Laboratoire Francais du Biofractionnement,"This trial is funded by the Programme Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique.

We aimed to assess the clinical and methodological characteristics of treatment clinical trials that have been set forth as an early response to the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsFirst, we reviewed all registered clinical trials on COVID-19. The World Health Organization International Trials Registry Platform and national trial registries were searched for COVID-19 trials through April 19th, 2020. For each record, independent researchers extracted interventions, participants, and methodological characteristics.Second, on September 14th, 2020 we evaluated the recruitment status and availability of the results of COVID-19 treatment trials previously identified.ResultsIn April 2020, a total of 580 trials evaluating COVID-19 treatment were registered. Reporting quality was poor (core participant information was missing in 24.1 to 92.7%). Between 54.0 and 93.8% of the trials did not plan to include older people or those with a higher baseline risk. Most studies were randomised (67.9%), single-centre (58.3%), non-industry-funded (81.1%), to be conducted in China (47.6%), with a median duration of 184days and a median sample size of 100 participants. Core endpoints (mortality, clinical status, and hospitalization length) were planned to be assessed in 5.2 to 13.1% of the trials. Five months later, 66 trials (11.4%) were reported as Completed, and only 46 (7.9%) had public results available. One hundred forty-four of 580 trials (24.8%) either had the status Not yet recruiting or Suspended, and 18 (3.1%) trials were prematurely stopped (Terminated or Withdrawn) The number of completed trials and trials with results are much lower than anticipated, considering the planned follow-up.ConclusionsOur results raise concerns about the success of the initial global research effort on COVID-19 treatment. The clinical and methodological characteristics of early COVID-19 treatment trials limit their capability to produce clear answers to critical questions in the shortest possible time.","[Mainoli, Beatrice; Machado, Tiago; Duarte, Goncalo S.; Prada, Luisa; Goncalves, Nilza; Ferreira, Joaquim J.; Costa, Joao] Univ Lisbon, Fac Med, Lab Clin Pharmacol & Therapeut, Ave Prof Egas Moniz, P-1649028 Lisbon, Portugal; [Mainoli, Beatrice; Machado, Tiago; Duarte, Goncalo S.; Prada, Luisa; Goncalves, Nilza; Ferreira, Joaquim J.; Costa, Joao] Univ Lisbon, Fac Med, Inst Med Mol, Lisbon, Portugal; [Duarte, Goncalo S.; Costa, Joao] Univ Lisbon, Fac Med, Ctr Estudos Med Baseada Evidencia, Lisbon, Portugal; [Goncalves, Nilza] Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova IMS, Lisbon, Portugal; [Costa, Joao] Cochrane Movement Disorders Grp, Lisbon, Portugal","Costa, J (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Fac Med, Lab Clin Pharmacol & Therapeut, Ave Prof Egas Moniz, P-1649028 Lisbon, Portugal.; Costa, J (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Fac Med, Inst Med Mol, Lisbon, Portugal.; Costa, J (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Fac Med, Ctr Estudos Med Baseada Evidencia, Lisbon, Portugal.; Costa, J (corresponding author), Cochrane Movement Disorders Grp, Lisbon, Portugal.",jncosta@fm.ul.pt,,"Costa, Joao/0000-0002-5831-4921",,,,28,0,0,0,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1471-2288,,BMC MED RES METHODOL,BMC Med.

Thus, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may improve respiratory failure. Objective: Assess safety of losartan for use in respiratory failure related to COVID-19 (NCT04335123). Methods: Single arm, open label trial of losartan in those hospitalized with respiratory failure related to COVID-19. Oral losartan (25 mg daily for 3 days, then 50 mg) was administered from enrollment until day 14 or hospital discharge. A post-hoc external control group with patients who met all inclusion criteria was matched 1:1 to the treatment group using propensity scores for comparison. Measures: Primary outcome was cumulative incidence of any adverse events. Secondary, explorative endpoints included measures of respiratory failure, length of stay and vital status. Results: Of the 34 participants enrolled in the trial, 30 completed the study with a mean age SD of 53.8 +/- 17.7 years and 17 males (57%). On losartan, 24/30 (80%) experienced an adverse event as opposed to 29/30 (97%) of controls, with a lower average number of adverse events on losartan relative to control (2.2 vs. 3.3). Using Poisson regression and controlling for age, sex, race, date of enrollment, disease severity at enrollment, and history of high-risk comorbidities, the incidence rate ratio of adverse events on losartan relative to control was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.49-0.97) Conclusions: Losartan appeared safe for COVID-19-related acute respiratory compromise. To assess true efficacy, randomized trials are needed.","[Bengtson, Charles D.; Montgomery, Robert N.; Nazir, Usman; Satterwhite, Lewis; Kim, Michael D.; Castro, Mario; Baumlin, Nathalie; Salathe, Matthias] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Div Pulm Crit Care & Sleep Med, Kansas City, KS 66103 USA; [Montgomery, Robert N.] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Biostat & Data Sci, Kansas City, KS 66103 USA; [Bahr, Nathan C.] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Div Infect Dis, Kansas City, KS 66103 USA","Salathe, M (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Div Pulm Crit Care & Sleep Med, Kansas City, KS 66103 USA.",msalathe@kumc.edu,,,KUMC department of internal medicine; NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences [UL1 -TR002366],Funds from the KUMC department of internal medicine and the NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences UL1 -TR002366 (CB).,,53,0,0,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-858X,,FRONT MED-LAUSANNE,Front.

This phase 3 clinical study is based on two parallel groups received either intravenous lidocaine 2% or intravenous NaCl 0.9%.ParticipantsThis study has been conducted at the University Hospitals of Strasbourg (medical and surgical Intensive Care Units in Hautepierre Hospital) since the 4th November 2020. The participants are 18 years-old and older, hospitalized in ICU for a moderate to severe ARDS according to the Berlin definition; they have to be intubated and sedated for mechanical protective ventilation. All participants are affiliated to the French Social security system and a dosage of beta HCG has to be negative for women of child bearing age .For the Covid-19 subgroup, the SARS-CoV2 infection is proved by RT-PCR <7 days before admission and/or another approved diagnostic technique and/or typical CT appearance pneumonia.The data are prospectively collected in e-Case Report Forms and extracted from clinical files.Intervention and comparatorThe participants are randomised in two parallel groups with a 1:1 ratio. In the experimental group, patients receive intravenous lidocaine 2% (20mg/mL) (from FRESENIUS KABI France); the infusion protocol provide a bolus of 1 mg/kg (ideal weight), followed by 3 mg/kg/h for the first hour, 1.5 mg/kg/h for the second hour, 0.72 mg/kg/h for the next 22 hours and then 0.6 mg/kg/h for 14 days at most or 24 hours after extubation or ventilator-weaning.The patients in the control group receive intravenous NaCl 0.9% (9 mg/mL) (from Aguettant, France) as placebo comparator; the infusion protocol provide a bolus of 0.05 mL/kg (ideal weight), followed by 0.15 mL/kg/h for the first hour, 0.075 mL/kg/h for the second hour, 0.036 mL/kg/h for the next 22 hours, and the 0.03 mL/kg/h for up to 14 days or 24 hours after extubation or ventilator-weaning. Lidocaine level is assessed at H4, D2, D7 and D14 to prevent local anesthetics systemic toxicity.Clinical data and biological samples are collected to assess disease progression.Main outcomesThe primary outcome is the evolution of alveolar-capillary gas exchange measured by the PaO2/FiO2 ratio after two days of treatment.The secondary endpoints of the study include the following: Evolution of PaO2/FiO2 ratio at admission and after 21 days of treatmentNumber of ventilator-free daysAnti-inflammatory effects by dosing inflammatory markers at different timepoints (ferritin, bicarbonate, CRP, PCT, LDH, IL-6, Troponin HS, triglycerides, complete blood count, lymphocytes)Anti-thrombotic effects by dosing platelets, aPTT, fibrinogen, D-dimers, viscoelastic testing and identification of all thromboembolic events up to 4 weeks.Plasmatic concentration of lidocaine and albuminIncidence of adverse events like cardiac rhythm disorders, need of vasopressors, any modification of the QRS, QTc or PR intervals every dayIleus recovery timeConsumption of hypnotics, opioids, neuromuscular blockers.Lengths of stay in the ICU, incidence of reintubation and complications due to intensive care unit care (mortality until 90 days, pneumothorax, bacterial pneumopathy, bronchospasm, cardiogenic shock, acute renal failure, need of renal dialysis, delirium, atrial fibrillation, stroke (CAM-ICU score), tetraplegia (MCR score)).

Emerging evidence suggests that patients with a cancer diagnosis are three times more likely to die from COVID-19 compared to non-cancer patients. Due to these observed risks, it is critical that emerging COVID-19 therapies demonstrate safety and efficacy among patients with cancer. Aim This study sought to examine reporting and representation of patients with cancer among published COVID-19 treatment-related research studies. Methods and results All published COVID-19 treatment-related clinical research studies published from March 1 to August 20, 2020 recruiting from North America and Europe were identified. The date published, study design, therapeutics studied, and study population were evaluated. Of the 343 studies identified through initial search and researcher knowledge, 55 (16%) reported on COVID-19 treatments. Twenty-one COVID-19 therapeutic studies (n = 15, prospective; n = 6, retrospective) that recruited from the United States and Europe were identified. Among these studies, eight (38%) reported on the number of trial participants with a cancer diagnosis in the publication and two (10%) specified tumor type. Four of the studies (19%) did not collect cancer history. Among studies where cancer history was available, patients with a cancer diagnosis participated at a proportion higher than overall cancer prevalence and greater than the known proportion of COVID-19 patients with cancer. Conclusion This study observed that cancer history was not uniformly collected or reported among published COVID-19 therapeutic studies. Among reported publications, we observed that patients with a cancer diagnosis were generally overrepresented. However, patients with a cancer diagnosis were notably underrepresented in outpatient COVID-19 therapeutic studies.","[Rabow, Maya] Northeastern Univ, Coll Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wang, Christine] San Diego State Univ, Div Acad Engagement & Student Achievement, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Zhang, Sylvia; Small, Eric J.; Borno, Hala T.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, Div Hematol Oncol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Tahir, Peggy Mary] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Lib Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Small, Eric J.; Borno, Hala T.] Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, San Francisco, CA USA","Rabow, M (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",rabow.m@northeastern.edu,,,Prostate Cancer Foundation; Lazarex Cancer Foundation,Lazarex Cancer Foundation; Prostate Cancer Foundation,,40,1,1,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,2573-8348,,CANCER REP-US,Cancer Rep.-US,,,,,,,,,,,e1355,10.1002/cnr2.1355,,FEB 2021,7,Oncology,Oncology,QP4GT,WOS:000623795400001,33621447,Other Gold,,,2021-03-31,

We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of azithromycin in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Methods In this randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]), several possible treatments were compared with usual care in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 in the UK. The trial is underway at 176 hospitals in the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated to either usual standard of care alone or usual standard of care plus azithromycin 500 mg once per day by mouth or intravenously for 10 days or until discharge (or allocation to one of the other RECOVERY treatment groups). Patients were assigned via web-based simple (unstratified) randomisation with allocation concealment and were twice as likely to be randomly assigned to usual care than to any of the active treatment groups. Participants and local study staff were not masked to the allocated treatment, but all others involved in the trial were masked to the outcome data during the trial. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, 50189673, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04381936. Findings Between April 7 and Nov 27, 2020, of 16 442 patients enrolled in the RECOVERY trial, 9433 (57%) were eligible and 7763 were included in the assessment of azithromycin. The mean age of these study participants was 65.3 years (SD 15.7) and approximately a third were women (2944 [38%] of 7763). 2582 patients were randomly allocated to receive azithromycin and 5181 patients were randomly allocated to usual care alone. Overall, 561 (22%) patients allocated to azithromycin and 1162 (22%) patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.87-1.07; p=0.50). No significant difference was seen in duration of hospital stay (median 10 days [IQR 5 to >28] vs 11 days [5 to >28]) or the proportion of patients discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (rate ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.98-1.10; p=0.19). Among those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, no significant difference was seen in the proportion meeting the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (risk ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.87-1.03; p=0.24). Interpretation In patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, azithromycin did not improve survival or other prespecified clinical outcomes. Azithromycin use in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 should be restricted to patients in whom there is a clear antimicrobial indication. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s).

To prevent adverse psychosocial outcomes in young carers (YCs), primary prevention resilience building interventions have been recommended. We describe the study protocol of an international randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an innovative group intervention designed to promote the mental health and well-being of adolescent YCs (AYCs) aged 15-17. The RCT will be conducted in six European countries in the context of the Horizon 2020 European funded research and innovation project Psychosocial support for promoting mental health and well-being among adolescent young caregivers in Europe (ME-WE). The ME-WE intervention is based on Hayes and Ciarrochi's psychoeducational model for adolescents and will consist of seven 2-h sessions in a group format, aimed to help AYCs build psychological flexibility and live according to their values. The control group will be a waitlist. Primary and secondary outcomes and control variables will be measured at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1) and 3 months follow-up (T2). The COVID-19 pandemic has made amendments necessary to the original study protocol methodology, which we describe in detail. This study will contribute to building an evidence-based manualized program that educators and health and social care professionals can use to support AYCs in their transition to adulthood. From a research perspective, the outcomes of this study will contribute to evidence-based practices in primary prevention of psychosocial difficulties in AYCs and will gather novel knowledge on the effectiveness of Hayes and Ciarrochi's model for use with middle adolescents with caring responsibilities.

Many clinical trials are currently underway to check the effectiveness of some known drugs. The physiopathology associated with the virus infection is currently better understood and good prophylactic drug therapies are implemented, such as antibiotics and blood thinners, though, no specific drugs against SARS-Cov-2 were developed yet. Objective: In the present research work, it is aimed to carry out a bibliographic investigation on some active molecular species that could be used against Covid-19, based on their chemical properties to bind to glycoproteins. In the case of SARS-Cov-2, the targeted glycoprotein is the surface virus spike S glycoprotein, that the virus uses to attach to and invade human cells. It is of high pharmacological value to investigate possible active natural substances endowed with a property to bind glycoproteins. In this line of research, oligosaccharides and lectins are two molecular species that have glycoprotein binding properties. Methods: A bibliographic research was carried out on oligosaccharides and lectins in various sources of scientific publications. Relevant chemical and pharmacological properties of oligosaccharides and lectins were searched and their main natural sources were identified. Results: In the present paper, I summarize some scientific evidence to support the therapeutic potential of camel milk as a source of oligosaccharides and its possible use as a functional diet in parallel to drug therapies of Covid-19. On the other hand, sugar and glycoprotein binding properties of some lectins of plant and seaweed origin are reported, and their pharmaceutical use is underlined. Conclusion: In the present study, scientific evidence was documented that encouraged further clinical investigations on camel milk oligosaccharides and lectins of plant and seaweed origin in the management of Covid-19 physiopathology.","[Errasfa, Mourad] Univ Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah, Fac Med & Pharm, Dept Pharmacol, Fes, Morocco","Errasfa, M (corresponding author), Univ Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah, Fac Med & Pharm, Dept Pharmacol, Fes, Morocco.",mourad.er-rasfa@usmba.ac.ma,,,,,,29,0,0,1,1,BENTHAM SCIENCE PUBL LTD,SHARJAH,"EXECUTIVE STE Y-2, PO BOX 7917, SAIF ZONE, 1200 BR SHARJAH, U ARAB EMIRATES",1573-4013,2212-3881,,CURR NUTR FOOD SCI,Curr.

This is a formative evaluation study of the HERizon Project, a home-based multi-component physical activity (PA) intervention for adolescent girls in the UK and Ireland. Although not intended, this study coincided with the initial COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. Methods. A total of 42 female participants, aged 13 to 16 years old (mean = 14.2, SD = 1.1), were randomly allocated to: (i) the HERizon group (n = 22) or (ii) the wait-list control group (n = 20). Participants in the six-week HERizon group were asked to complete three PA sessions each week and engage in weekly behaviour change support video calls. The primary outcome measure was self-reported habitual PA. Secondary outcomes measures included cardiorespiratory fitness (20 m shuttle run), muscular strength (standing long jump), muscular endurance (push up test), and psychosocial outcomes (Perceived Competence Scale, Body Appreciation Scale, Self-Esteem Questionnaire, Behavioural Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire). Quantitative and qualitative process evaluation data were also collected. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline and after the six-week intervention. Results. There was no significant change in habitual PA between groups (LMM group*time interaction: p = 0.767). The HERizon group had significantly increased cardiorespiratory fitness (p = 0.001), muscular endurance (p = 0.022), intrinsic motivation (p = 0.037), and body appreciation (p < 0.003) in comparison to the wait-list control group. All participants in the intervention group completed the intervention and compliance to the intervention was high (participants completed 18 +/- 2 sessions). Conclusions. Although no change in PA was observed, HERizon resulted in improved physical fitness and psychosocial outcomes. These preliminary findings, alongside positive findings for feasibility and acceptability, highlight potential benefits from the home-based intervention, thus further investigation is warranted.","[Cowley, Emma S.; Watson, Paula M.; Foweather, Lawrence; Mansfield, Chiara; Whitcomb-Khan, Gabriella; Cacciatore, Isabella; Thijssen, Dick; Wagenmakers, Anton J.

For proper translation of these results to clinical guidelines, it is essential to determine how well the general population is reflected in the study populations of these trials. This study was conducted among 7162 participants (age-range: 51-106 years; 58% women) from the Rotterdam Study. We quantified the proportion of participants that would be eligible for the nine ongoing phase-III trials. We further quantified the eligibility among participants at high risk to develop severe COVID-19. Since many trials were not explicit in their exclusion criterion with respect to 'acute' or 'unstable preexisting' diseases, we performed two analyses. First, we included all participants irrespective of this criterion. Second, we excluded persons with acute or 'unstable preexisting' diseases. 97% of 7162 participants was eligible for any trial with eligibility for separate trials ranging between 11-97%. For high-risk individuals the corresponding numbers were 96% for any trial with separate trials ranging from 5-96%. Importantly, considering persons ineligible due to 'acute' or 'unstable pre-existing' disease drastically dropped the eligibilities for all trials below 43% for the total population and below 36% for high-risk individuals. The eligibility for ongoing vaccine trials against SARS-CoV-2 can reduce by half depending on interpretation and application of a single unspecified exclusion criterion. This exclusion criterion in our study would especially affect the elderly and those with pre-existing morbidities. These findings thus indicate the difficulty as well as importance of developing clinical recommendations for vaccination and applying these to the appropriate target populations. This becomes especially paramount considering the fact that many countries worldwide have initiated their vaccination programs by first targeting the elderly and most vulnerable persons.","[Terzikhan, Natalie; Ikram, Mohammad Arfan] Erasmus MC, Dept Epidemiol, Wytemaweg 80, NL-3015 CN Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Hofman, Albert; Goudsmit, Jaap] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Boston, MA USA; [Goudsmit, Jaap] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Human Immun Initiat, Boston, MA USA; [Goudsmit, Jaap] Human Vaccines Project, Boston, MA USA; [Goudsmit, Jaap] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Immunol & Infect Dis, Boston, MA USA","Ikram, MA (corresponding author), Erasmus MC, Dept Epidemiol, Wytemaweg 80, NL-3015 CN Rotterdam, Netherlands.",m.a.ikram@erasmusmc.nl,,,"Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam; Erasmus University, Rotterdam; Netherlands Organization for the Health Research and Development (ZonMw)Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development; Research Institute for Diseases in the Elderly (RIDE); Ministry of Education, Culture and ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); Ministry for Health, Welfare and Sports; European Commission (DG XII)European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre; Municipality of Rotterdam","The Rotterdam Study is funded by Erasmus Medical Center and Erasmus University, Rotterdam, Netherlands Organization for the Health Research and Development (ZonMw), the Research Institute for Diseases in the Elderly (RIDE), the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, the Ministry for Health, Welfare and Sports, the European Commission (DG XII), and the Municipality of Rotterdam.

We investigated CoronaVac (Sinovac Life Sciences, Beijing, China), an inactivated vaccine candidate against COVID-19, containing inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), for its safety, tolerability and immunogenicity. Methods In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 clinical trial, healthy adults aged 18-59 years were recruited from the community in Suining County of Jiangsu province, China. Adults with SARS-CoV-2 exposure or infection history, with axillary temperature above 37.0 degrees C, or an allergic reaction to any vaccine component were excluded. The experimental vaccine for the phase 1 trial was manufactured using a cell factory process (CellSTACK Cell Culture Chamber 10, Corning, Wujiang, China), whereas those for the phase 2 trial were produced through a bioreactor process (ReadyToProcess WAVE 25, GE, Umea, Sweden). The phase 1 trial was done in a dose-escalating manner. At screening, participants were initially separated (1:1), with no specific randomisation, into two vaccination schedule cohorts, the days 0 and 14 vaccination cohort and the days 0 and 28 vaccination cohort, and within each cohort the first 36 participants were assigned to block 1 (low dose CoronaVac [3 mu g per 0.5 mL of aluminium hydroxide diluent per dose) then another 36 were assigned to block 2 (high-dose Coronavc [6 mu g per 0.5 mL of aluminium hydroxide diluent per dse]). Within each block, participants were randomly assigned (2:1), using block randomisation with a block size of six, to either two doses of CoronaVac or two doses of placebo. In the phase 2 trial, at screening, participants were initially separated (1:1), with no specific randomisation, into the days 0 and 14 vaccination cohort and the days 0 and 28 vaccination cohort, and participants were randomly assigned (2:2:1), using block randomisation with a block size of five, to receive two doses of either low-dose CoronaVac, high-dose CoronaVac, or placebo. Participants, investigators, and laboratory staff were masked to treatment allocation. The primary safety endpoint was adverse reactions within 28 days after injection in all participants who were given at least one dose of study drug (safety population). The primary immunogenic outcome was seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies to live SARS-CoV-2 at day 14 after the last dose in the days 0 and 14 cohort, and at day 28 after the last dose in the days 0 and 28 cohort in participants who completed their allocated two-dose vaccination schedule (per-protocol population). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04352608, and is closed to accrual. Findings Between April 16 and April 25, 2020, 144 participants were enrolled in the phase 1 trial, and between May 3 and May 5, 2020, 600 participants were enrolled in the phase 2 trial. 743 participants received at least one dose of investigational product (n=143 for phase 1 and n=600 for phase 2; safety population). In the phase 1 trial, the incidence of adverse reactions for the days 0 and 14 cohort was seven (29%) of 24 participants in the 3 ug group, nine (38%) of 24 in the 6 mu g group, and two (8%) of 24 in the placebo group, and for the days 0 and 28 cohort was three (13%) of 24 in the 3 mu g group, four (17%) of 24 in the 6 mu g group, and three (13%) of 23 in the placebo group. The seroconversion of neutralising antibodies on day 14 after the days 0 and 14 vaccination schedule was seen in 11 (46%) of 24 participants in the 3 mu g group, 12 (50%) of 24 in the 6 mu g group, and none (0%) of 24 in the placebo group; whereas at day 28 after the days 0 and 28 vaccination schedule, seroconversion was seen in 20 (83%) of 24 in the 3 mu g group, 19 (79%) of 24 in the 6 mu g group, and one (4%) of 24 in the placebo group. In the phase 2 trial, the incidence of adverse reactions for the days 0 and 14 cohort was 40 (33%) of 120 participants in the 3 mu g group, 42 (35%) of 120 in the 6 mu g group, and 13 (22%) of 60 in the placebo group, and for the days 0 and 28 cohort was 23 (19%) of 120 in the 3 mu g group, 23 (19%) of 120 in the 6 mu g group, and 11 (18%) of 60 for the placebo group. Seroconversion of neutralising antibodies was seen for 109 (92%) of 118 participants in the 3 mu g group, 117 (98%) of 119 in the 6 mu g group, and two (3%) of 60 in the placebo group at day 14 after the days 0 and 14 schedule; whereas at day 28 after the days 0 and 28 schedule, seroconversion was seen in 114 (97%) of 117 in the 3 mu g group, 118 (100%) of 118 in the 6 mu g group, and none (0%) of 59 in the placebo group. Interpretation Taking safety, immunogenicity, and production capacity into account, the 3 mu g dose of CoronaVac is the suggested dose for efficacy assessment in future phase 3 trials.

Given the widespread use of ACEi/ARBs worldwide, guidance on the use of these drugs is urgently needed. This prospective meta-analysis aims to pool data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the safety and efficacy of ACEi/ARB therapy in adults infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods and analysis RCTs will be eligible if they compare patients with COVID-19 randomised to ACEi/ARB continuation or commencement versuss no ACEi/ARB therapy; study duration >= 14 days; recruitment completed between March 2020 and May 2021. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality at <= 30 days. Secondary outcomes will include mechanical ventilation, admission to intensive care or cardiovascular events at short-term follow-up (<= 30 days) and all-cause mortality at longer-term follow-up (>1 month). Prespecified subgroup analyses will assess the effect of sex; age; comorbidities; smoking status; ethnicity; country of origin on all-cause mortality. A search of ClinicalTrials.gov has been performed, which will be followed by a formal search of trial registers, preprint servers, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify RCTs that meet inclusion criteria. To date, a search of ClinicalTrials.gov identified 21 potentially eligible trials for this meta-analysis. We will request trial investigators/sponsors to contribute standardised grouped tabular outcome data. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval and informed consent will be the responsibility of the individual RCTs. Dissemination of results will occur by peer-reviewed publication. The results of our analysis can inform public health policy and clinical decision making regarding ACEi/ARB use in patients with COVID-19 on a global scale.","[Gnanenthiran, Sonali Rukshana; Rodgers, Anthony; Schutte, Aletta E.] Univ New South Wales, George Inst Global Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Borghi, Claudio] Univ Bologna, Dept Med & Surg Sci, Bologna, Italy; [Burger, Dylan] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa Hosp, Kidney Res Ctr, Dept Cellular & Mol Med,Res Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Charchar, Fadi] Federat Univ Australia, Sch Hlth & Life Sci, Ballarat, Vic, Australia; [Poulter, Neil R.] Imperial Coll London, Imperial Clin Trials Unit, London, England; [Schlaich, Markus P.] Univ Western Australia, Royal Perth Hosp Unit, Dobney Hypertens Ctr, Sch Med, Perth, WA, Australia; [Steckelings, Ulrike Muscha] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Cardiovasc & Renal Res, Odense, Denmark; [Stergiou, George] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Sotiria Hosp, Dept Med 3, Hypertens Ctr STRIDE 7,Sch Med, Athens, Greece; [Tomaszewski, Maciej] Manchester Univ NHS Fdn Trust Manchester, Div Med, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Tomaszewski, Maciej] Manchester Univ NHS Fdn Trust Manchester, Manchester Acad Hlth Sci Ctr, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Unger, Thomas] Maastricht Univ, CARIM Sch Cardiovasc Dis, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Wainford, Richard D.] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol & Expt Therapeut, Boston, MA USA; [Wainford, Richard D.] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Whitaker Cardiovasc Inst, Boston, MA USA; [Williams, Bryan] UCL, Inst Cardiovasc Sci, London, England; [Williams, Bryan] Univ Coll London Hosp, Biomed Res Ctr, Natl Inst Hlth Res NIHR, London, England","Schutte, AE (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, George Inst Global Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",a.schutte@unsw.edu.au,,"Steckelings, Ulrike Muscha/0000-0002-5430-4275; Gnanenthiran, Sonali/0000-0003-4145-6461; Schlaich, Markus/0000-0002-1765-0195",,,,29,0,0,0,0,BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND",2044-6055,,,BMJ OPEN,BMJ Open,,2021,11,2,,,,,,,e043625,10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043625,,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,QL4XX,WOS:000621082800009,33593784,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2021-03-31,

Design We present the results of a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of colchicine for the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19, with 75 patients allocated 1:1 from 11 April to 30 August 2020. Colchicine regimen was 0.5 mg thrice daily for 5 days, then 0.5 mg twice daily for 5 days. The primary endpoints were the need for supplemental oxygen, time of hospitalisation, need for admission and length of stay in intensive care unit and death rate. Results Seventy-two patients (36 for placebo and 36 for colchicine) completed the study. Median (and IQR) time of need for supplemental oxygen was 4.0 (2.0-6.0) days for the colchicine group and 6.5 (4.0-9.0) days for the placebo group (p<0.001). Median (IQR) time of hospitalisation was 7.0 (5.0-9.0) days for the colchicine group and 9.0 (7.0-12.0) days for the placebo group (p=0.003). At day 2, 67% versus 86% of patients maintained the need for supplemental oxygen, while at day 7, the values were 9% versus 42%, in the colchicine and the placebo groups, respectively (log rank; p=0.001). Two patients died, both in placebo group. Diarrhoea was more frequent in the colchicine group (p=0.26). Conclusion Colchicine reduced the length of both, supplemental oxygen therapy and hospitalisation. The drug was safe and well tolerated. Once death was an uncommon event, it is not possible to ensure that colchicine reduced mortality of COVID-19.","[Lopes, Maria Isabel; Bonjorno, Leticia P.; Giannini, Marcela C.; Amaral, Natalia B.; Menezes, Pamella Indira; Dib, Saulo Musse; Gigante, Samara Libich; Benatti, Maira N.; Rezek, Uebe C.; Emrich-Filho, Laerte L.; Sousa, Betania A.

Oman is no exception to this, with several studies indicating high levels of anxiety and depression among the Omani public. There is a need for adaptive and effective interventions that aim to improve the elevated levels of psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: This study aimed to comparatively assess the efficacy of therapist-guided online therapy with that of self-help, internet-based therapy focusing on COVID-19-induced symptoms of anxiety and depression among individuals living in Oman during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This was a 6-week-long pragmatic randomized controlled trial involving 60 participants who were recruited from a study sample surveyed for symptoms of anxiety or depression among the Omani public amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants in the intervention group were allocated to receive 1 online session per week for 6 weeks from certified psychotherapists in Oman; these sessions were conducted in Arabic or English. The psychotherapists utilized cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy interventions. Participants in the control group received an automatic weekly newsletter via email containing self-help information and tips to cope with distress associated with COVID-19. The information mainly consisted of behavioral tips revolving around the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy. The primary outcome was measured by comparing the change in the mean scores of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale from the baseline to the end of the study (ie, after 6 sessions) between the two groups. The secondary outcome was to compare the proportions of participants with depression and anxiety between the two groups. Results: Data from 46 participants were analyzed (intervention group n=22, control group n=24). There was no statistical difference in the baseline characteristics between both groups. Analysis of covariance indicated a significant reduction in the GAD-7 scores (F-1,F-43 =7.307; P=.01) between the two groups after adjusting for baseline scores. GAD-7 scores of participants in the intervention group were considerably more reduced than those of participants in the control group (beta=-3.27; P=.01). Moreover, a greater reduction in mean PHQ-9 scores was observed among participants in the intervention group (F-1,F-43 =8.298; P=.006) than those in the control group (beta=-4.311; P=.006). Although the levels of anxiety and depression reduced in both study groups, the reduction was higher in the intervention group (P=.049) than in the control group (P=.02). Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence to support the efficacy of online therapy for improving the symptoms of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 crisis in Oman Therapist-guided online therapy was found to be superior to self-help, internet-based therapy; however, both therapies could be considered as viable options.","[Al-Alawi, Mohammed; Al Balushi, Naser; Al Sinawi, Hamed] Sultan Qaboos Univ Hosp, Dept Behav Med, Muscat 123, Oman; [McCall, Roopa K.] Al Harub Med Ctr, Muscat, Oman; [Sultan, Alya] Euonia Clin, Muscat, Oman; [Al-Mahrouqi, Tamadhir; Al Ghailani, Abdullah; Al Sabti, Hilal; Al-Maniri, Abdullah; Panchatcharam, Sathiya M.] Oman Med Specialty Board, Muscat, Oman","Al-Alawi, M (corresponding author), Sultan Qaboos Univ Hosp, Dept Behav Med, Muscat 123, Oman.",alalawim@squ.edu.om,"ALbalushi, Naser/AAE-3692-2021","ALbalushi, Naser/0000-0002-7135-5103; Al-Alawi, Mohammed/0000-0001-6388-5377; Al-Mahrouqi, Tamadhir/0000-0002-7429-1504; Al Sinawi, Hamed/0000-0001-6705-8459; Al Sabti, Hilal/0000-0001-6270-9013; McCall, Roopa K/0000-0003-0458-8916","Research Council, Sultanate of OmanMinistry of Higher Education, Research & Innovation, OmanThe Research Council Oman","We would like to acknowledge the individuals who participated in the study and the therapists who provided the guided online therapy to all study participants.

Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic, known for its immunomodulatory properties. It has shown antiviral effect specifically against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and acts on cytokine signaling pathways that have been implicated in COVID-19. Methods DAWn-AZITHRO is a randomized, open-label, phase 2 proof-of-concept, multicenter clinical trial, evaluating the safety and efficacy of azithromycin for treating hospitalized patients with COVID-19. It is part of a series of trials testing promising interventions for COVID-19, running in parallel and grouped under the name DAWn-studies. Patients hospitalized on dedicated COVID wards are eligible for study inclusion when they are symptomatic (i.e., clinical or radiological signs) and have been diagnosed with COVID-19 within the last 72 h through PCR (nasopharyngeal swab or bronchoalveolar lavage) or chest CT scan showing typical features of COVID-19 and without alternate diagnosis. Patients are block-randomized (9 patients) with a 2:1 allocation to receive azithromycin plus standard of care versus standard of care alone. Standard of care is mostly supportive, but may comprise hydroxychloroquine, up to the treating physician's discretion and depending on local policy and national health regulations. The treatment group receives azithromycin qd 500 mg during the first 5 consecutive days after inclusion. The trial will include 284 patients and recruits from 15 centers across Belgium. The primary outcome is time from admission (day 0) to life discharge or to sustained clinical improvement, defined as an improvement of two points on the WHO 7-category ordinal scale sustained for at least 3 days. Discussion The trial investigates the urgent and still unmet global need for drugs that may impact the disease course of COVID-19. It will either provide support or else justify the discouragement of the current widespread, uncontrolled use of azithromycin in patients with COVID-19. The analogous design of other parallel trials of the DAWN consortium will amplify the chance of identifying successful treatment strategies and allow comparison of treatment effects within an identical clinical context.","[Gyselinck, Iwein; Liesenborgs, Laurens; Landeloos, Ewout; Verhamme, Peter; Vos, Robin; Janssens, W.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Univ Ziekenhuizen Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; [Belmans, Ann; Verbeke, Geert] Interuniv Inst Biostat & Stat Bioinformat, Leuven, Belgium","Gyselinck, I (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Univ Ziekenhuizen Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.",iwein.gyselinck@kuleuven.be,"WAN, JIE/AAK-1127-2021; Verbeke, Geert/I-5587-2015","Verbeke, Geert/0000-0001-8430-7576; Gyselinck, Iwein/0000-0002-4068-7228",Research foundation flandersFWO [G0G4720N]; Univ.

Corticosteroids decrease mortality in severely or critically ill patients with COVID-19. However, the optimal dose remains unresolved. The ongoing randomised COVID STEROID 2 trial investigates the effects of higher vs lower doses of dexamethasone (12 vs 6 mg intravenously daily for up to 10 days) in 1,000 adult patients with COVID-19 and severe hypoxia. Methods This protocol outlines the rationale and statistical methods for a secondary, pre-planned Bayesian analysis of the primary outcome (days alive without life support at day 28) and all secondary outcomes registered up to day 90. We will use hurdle-negative binomial models to estimate the mean number of days alive without life support in each group and present results as mean differences and incidence rate ratios with 95% credibility intervals (CrIs). Additional count outcomes will be analysed similarly and binary outcomes will be analysed using logistic regression models with results presented as probabilities, relative risks and risk differences with 95% CrIs. We will present probabilities of any benefit/harm, clinically important benefit/harm and probabilities of effects smaller than pre-defined clinically minimally important differences for all outcomes analysed. Analyses will be adjusted for stratification variables and conducted using weakly informative priors supplemented by sensitivity analyses using sceptic priors. Discussion This secondary, pre-planned Bayesian analysis will supplement the primary, conventional analysis and may help clinicians, researchers and policymakers interpret the results of the COVID STEROID 2 trial while avoiding arbitrarily dichotomised interpretations of the results.

While the entire medical fraternity and scientists are putting their best feet forward to find a solution to contain this deadly pandemic, there is a growing interest in integrating other known alternative therapies in to standard care. This study is aimed at evaluating the safety and efficacy of ozone therapy (OT), as an adjuvant to the standard of care (SOC). Methods: In the current randomized control trial, 60 patients with mild to moderate score NEWS score were included in two parallel groups (n = 30/group). The interventional group (OZ) received ozonized rectal insufflation and minor auto haemotherapy, daily along with SOC, while the control group (ST) received SOC alone. The main outcome measures included changes in clinical features, oxygenation index (SpO(2)), NEWS score, Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR), inflammatory markers, requirement of advanced care, and metabolic profiles. Results: The OZ group has shown clinically significant improvement in the mean values of all the parameters tested compared to ST Group. However, statistical significance were only observed in RT-PCR negative reaction (P = 0.01), changes in clinical symptoms (P < 0.05) and requirement for Intensive care (P < 0.05). No adverse events were reported in OZ group, as against 2 deaths reported in ST group. Conclusion: OT when integrated with SOC can improve the clinical status and rapidly reduce the viral load compared to SOC alone, which facilitate early recovery and check the need for advanced care and mortality as demonstrated in this study.","[Shah, Mili] Ozone Forum India, Training & Educ Dept, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Captain, Jignasha] Clin Dept, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Captain, Jignasha] Ozone Forum India, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Vaidya, Vidyadhar; Valsangkar, Kedar] Lokmanya Med Res Ctr, Dept Ozone Therapy, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Kulkarni, Arvind] Integrated Canc Treatment & Res Ctr, Dept Oncol, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Nair, Pradeep M.

Objectives: We assessed the impact of Tubaramure, a FA-MCHN program in Burundi, on child (0 to 24 months) wasting and the differential impacts by socio-economic characteristics and age. The program targeted women and their children during the first 1000 days and included 1) food rations, 2) strengthening and promotion of use of health services, and 3) behavior change communication (BCC). Methods: We conducted a 4-arm, cluster-randomized, controlled trial (2010-2012). Clusters were defined as collines (communities). Impact was estimated using repeated cross-sectional data (n = similar to 2620 children in each round). Treatment arms received household and individual (mother or child in the first 1000 days) food rations (corn-soy blend and micronutrient-fortified vegetable oil) from pregnancy to 24 months (T24 arm), from pregnancy to 18 months (T18), or from birth to 24 months (TNFP). All beneficiaries received the same BCC for the first 1000 days. The control arm received no rations or BCC. Results: Wasting (weight-for-length Z-score <2 SD) increased from baseline to follow-up in the control group (from 6.5% to 8%), but Tubaramure had a significant (P < 0.05) protective effect on wasting [treatment arms combined, -3.3 percentage points (pp); T18, -4.5 pp] and on the weight-for-length z-score (treatment arms combined, +0.15; T24, +0.20; T18, +0.17). The effects were limited to children whose mother and household head had no education, and who lived in the poorest households. The largest effect was found in children 6 to 12 months of age: the group with the highest wasting prevalence. Conclusions: FA-MCHN programs in highly food-insecure regions can protect the most disadvantaged children from wasting. These findings are particularly relevant in the context of the economic crisis due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, which is expected to dramatically increase child wasting.

To date, no children younger than 12 years have been enrolled in clinical trials. Key challenges and knowledge gaps that must be addressed include (1) rationale for vaccines in children, (2) possible effects of immune maturation during childhood, (3) ethical concerns, (4) unique needs of children with developmental disorders and chronic conditions, (5) health inequities, and (6) vaccine hesitancy. Because COVID-19 is minimally symptomatic in the vast majority of children, a higher acceptable risk threshold is required when evaluating pediatric clinical trials. Profound differences in innate and adaptive immunity during childhood and adolescence are known to affect vaccine responsiveness for a variety of childhood diseases. COVID-19 and the accompanying social disruption, such as the school shutdowns, has been disproportionately damaging to minority and low-income children. In this commentary, we briefly address each of these key issues, specify research gaps, and suggest a broader learning health system approach to accelerate testing and clinical trial development for an ethical and effective strategy to implement a pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccine as rapidly and safely as possible. Impact As the US begins an unprecedented implementation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, substantial knowledge gaps have yet to be addressed regarding vaccinations in the pediatric population. Maturational changes in the immune system during childhood have influenced the effectiveness of pediatric vaccines for other diseases and conditions, and could affect SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responsiveness in children. Given that COVID-19 disease is far milder in the majority of children than in adults, the risk-benefit of a pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccine must be carefully weighed. The needs of children with developmental disabilities and with chronic disease must be addressed. Minority and low-income children have been disproportionately adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; care must be taken to address issues of health equity regarding pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials and allocation. Research and strategies to address general vaccine hesitancy in communities must be addressed in the context of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","[Cooper, Dan M.; Golub, Sidney; Lucas, Candice Taylor; Ulloa, Erlinda R.] UC Irvine, Inst Clin & Translat Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Afghani, Behnoush] UC Irvine, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Irvine, CA USA; [Byington, Carrie L.; Zaldivar, Frank] Univ Calif Hlth, Oakland, CA USA; [Cunningham, Coleen K.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Durham, NC USA; [Lu, Kim D.; Radom-Aizik, Shlomit] UC Irvine, Sch Med, Pediat Exercise & Genom Res Ctr, Irvine, CA USA; [Ross, Lainie Friedman] Univ Chicago, Dept Pediat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Singh, Jasjit; Ulloa, Erlinda R.] CHOC Childrens Hosp, Div Infect Dis, Orange, CA 92868 USA; [Smoyer, William E.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Pediat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Smoyer, William E.] Nationwide Childrens Hosp, Columbus, OH USA; [Tunney, Jessica] TLC Publ Charter Sch, Orange, CA USA","Ulloa, ER (corresponding author), UC Irvine, Inst Clin & Translat Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.; Ulloa, ER (corresponding author), CHOC Childrens Hosp, Div Infect Dis, Orange, CA 92868 USA.",chulie.ulloa@uci.edu,,,NIH NCATS UCI Clinical and Translational Science Award [UL1 TR001414]; Robert Wood Johnson FoundationRobert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF),The authors acknowledge NIH NCATS UCI Clinical and Translational Science Award UL1 TR001414.

The sharing of trial data is not the norm, but the unprecedented pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 may serve as an impetus for greater data sharing. We sought to assess the data sharing intentions of interventional COVID-19 trials as declared in trial registrations and publications. Methods: We searched and PubMed for COVID-19 interventional trials. We analyzed responses to fields regarding intent to share individual participant level data and analyzed the data sharing statements in eligible publications. Results: Nine hundred twenty-four trial registrations were analyzed. 15.7% were willing to share, of which 38.6% were willing to share immediately upon publication of results. 47.6% declared they were not willing to share. Twenty-eight publications were analyzed representing 26 unique COVID-19 trials. Only seven publications contained data sharing statements; six indicated a willingness to share data whereas one indicated that data was not available for sharing. Conclusions: At a time of pressing need for researchers to work together to combat a global pandemic, intent to share individual participant-level data from COVID-19 interventional trials is limited.","[Li, Rebecca; Levenstein, Marcia; Neumann, Stan; Wood, Julie; Sim, Ida] Vivli, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Li, Rebecca] Harvard, Ctr Bioeth, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [von Isenburg, Megan] Duke Univ, Durham, NC USA; [Sim, Ida] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Li, R (corresponding author), Vivli, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.; Li, R (corresponding author), Harvard, Ctr Bioeth, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",rli@vivli.org,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1745-6215,,TRIALS,Trials,FEB 18,2021,22,1,,,,,,,153,10.1186/s13063-021-05104-z,,,5,"Medicine, Research & Experimental",Research & Experimental Medicine,QL3MN,WOS:000620984300001,33602275,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2021-03-31,

Yet launching and implementing trials with the rigor necessary to produce convincing results is a complicated and time-consuming process. Balancing rigor and efficiency involves relying on designs that employ flexible features to respond to a fast-changing landscape, measuring valid endpoints that result in translational actions and disseminating findings in a timely manner. We describe the challenges involved in creating infrastructure with potential utility for shared learning. Methods: We have established a shared infrastructure that borrows strength across multiple trials. The infrastructure includes an endpoint registry to aid in selecting appropriate endpoints, a registry to facilitate establishing a Data & Safety Monitoring Board, common data collection instruments, a COVID-19 dedicated design and analysis team, and a pragmatic platform protocol, among other elements. Results: The authors have relied on the shared infrastructure for six clinical trials for which they serve as the Data Coordinating Center and have a design and analysis team comprising 15 members who are dedicated to COVID-19. The authors established a pragmatic platform to simultaneously investigate multiple treatments for the outpatient with adaptive features to add or drop treatment arms. Conclusion: The shared infrastructure provides appealing opportunities to evaluate disease in a more robust manner with fewer resources and is especially valued during a pandemic where efficiency in time and resources is crucial. The most important element of the shared infrastructure is the pragmatic platform. While it may be the most challenging of the elements to establish, it may provide the greatest benefit to both patients and researchers.","[Hedlin, Haley; Garcia, Ariadna; Weng, Yingjie; Sundaram, Vandana; Bunning, Bryan; Balasubramanian, Vidhya; Cunanan, Kristen; Kapphahn, Kristopher; Gummidipundi, Santosh; Purington, Natasha; Boulos, Mary; Desai, Manisha] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Quantitat Sci Unit,Div Biomed Informat Res, 1701 Page Mill Rd, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [He, Ziyuan] Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Sch Med, Sean N Parker Ctr Allergy & Asthma Res, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Desai, M (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Quantitat Sci Unit,Div Biomed Informat Res, 1701 Page Mill Rd, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA.",manishad@stanford.edu,,,"National Institute of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [UL1-TR003142, P30CA124435, P30-DK116074, U24-HL141727]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was partially supported by the National Institute of Health under Grant Nos.

The good news is that interventions to be tested are not in short supply. Unfortunately, the human and material resources needed to conduct these trials are finite. It is essential that trials be robust and meet enrollment targets and that lower-quality studies not be permitted to displace higher-quality studies, delaying answers to critical questions. Yet, with few exceptions, existing research review bodies and processes are not designed to ensure these conditions are satisfied. To meet this challenge, we offer guidance for research institutions about how to ethically consolidate and prioritize COVID-19 clinical trials, while recognizing that consolidation and prioritization should also take place upstream (among manufacturers and funders) and at a higher level (e.g. nationally). In our proposed three-stage process, trials must first meet threshold criteria. Those that do are evaluated in a second stage to determine whether the institution has sufficient capacity to support all proposed trials. If it does not, the third stage entails evaluating studies against two additional sets of comparative prioritization criteria: those specific to the study and those that aim to advance diversification of an institution's research portfolio. To implement these criteria fairly, we propose that research institutions form COVID-19 research prioritization committees. We briefly discuss some important attributes of these committees, drawing on the authors' experiences at our respective institutions. Although we focus on clinical trials of COVID-19 therapeutics, our guidance should prove useful for other kinds of COVID-19 research, as well as non-pandemic research, which can raise similar challenges due to the scarcity of research resources.","[Meyer, Michelle N.] Geisinger Hlth Syst, Ctr Translat Bioeth & Hlth Care Policy, 100 North Acad Ave, Danville, PA 17822 USA; [Meyer, Michelle N.] Geisinger Hlth Syst, Steele Inst Hlth Innovat, 100 North Acad Ave, Danville, PA 17822 USA; [Gelinas, Luke] Advarra, Columbia, MD USA; [Bierer, Barbara E.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bierer, Barbara E.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hull, Sara Chandros] NIH, Dept Bioeth, Clin Ctr, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Joffe, Steven; Lynch, Holly Fernandez] Univ Penn, Dept Med Eth & Hlth Policy, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Joffe, Steven; Lynch, Holly Fernandez] Univ Penn, Leonard Davis Inst Hlth Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Magnus, David] Stanford Univ, Ctr Biomed Eth, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Mohapatra, Seema] Indiana Univ, Robert H McKinney Sch Law, Indianapolis, IN 46204 USA; [Sharp, Richard R.] Mayo Clin, Div Hlth Care Policy Res, Biomed Eth Program, Rochester, MN USA; [Spector-Bagdady, Kayte] Univ Michigan, Med Sch, Ctr Bioeth & Social Sci Med, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Sugarman, Jeremy] Johns Hopkins Univ, Berman Inst Bioeth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Sugarman, Jeremy] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Med, Baltimore, MD USA; [Wilfond, Benjamin S.] Seattle Childrens Hosp & Res Inst, Treuman Katz Ctr Pediat Bioeth, Seattle, WA USA","Meyer, MN (corresponding author), Geisinger Hlth Syst, Ctr Translat Bioeth & Hlth Care Policy, 100 North Acad Ave, Danville, PA 17822 USA.; Meyer, MN (corresponding author), Geisinger Hlth Syst, Steele Inst Hlth Innovat, 100 North Acad Ave, Danville, PA 17822 USA.",mmeyer@geisinger.edu,,"Meyer, Michelle/0000-0001-5497-8803","Greenwall Foundation; Intramural Research Program of the National Human Genome Research InstituteUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI); National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; National Center for Advancing Translational SciencesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1TR003142-01, UL1TR002319, UL1TR002240, UL1TR003098]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by The Greenwall Foundation, the Intramural Research Program of the National Human Genome Research Institute, the National Institutes of Health, and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (grant nos UL1TR003142-01, UL1TR002319, UL1TR002240, and UL1TR003098).",,41,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1740-7745,1740-7753,,CLIN TRIALS,Clin.

Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) predisposes males to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease, while the use of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (SARis) and androgen receptor antagonists reduce COVID-19 disease severity. In this study, we aimed to determine the potential benefit of dutasteride, a commonly used broad and potent 5ARi, as a treatment for COVID-19. Design, setting, and participants The study was conducted at outpatient clinics. Subjects presented to the clinics with a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) lest taken within 24 hours of recruitment. All subjects presented with mild to moderate symptoms. Interventions Subjects were given either dutasteride 0.5 mg/day or placebo for 30 days or until full COVID-19 remission. All subjects received standard therapy with nitazoxanide 500 mg twice a day for six days and azithromycin 500 mg/day for five days. Main outcome(s) and measure(s) The main outcome(s) and measure(s) were as follows: time to remission, oxygen saturation (%), positivity rates of RT-PCR-SARS-CoV-2, and biochemical analysis [ultrasensitive C-reactive protein (usCRP), D-dimer, lactate, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), ultrasensitive troponin, and ferritin]. Results Subjects taking dutasteride (n=43) demonstrated reduced fatigue, anosmia, and overall disease duration compared to subjects taking a placebo (n=44) (p<.0001 for all). Compared to the placebo group, on Day seven, subjects taking dutasleride had a higher virologic remission rate (64.3% versus 11.8%; v.0094), higher clinical recovery rate (84.7% versus 57.5%; p=.03), higher mean [standard deviation: SDI oxygen saturation (97.0% [1.4%] versus 95.7% [2.0%]; p=.02), lower median [Interquartile range: IQR] usCRP (0.34 mg/L [0.23 mg/L-0.66 mg/L] versus 1.47 mg/L [0.70 mg/L-3.37 mg/L]; p<.0001), lower median [IQR] lactate (2.01 mmol/L[1.12 mmol/L-2.43 mmol/L] versus 2.66 mmol/L [2.05 mmol/L-3.55 mmol/L]; p=.0049), lower median [IQR] ESR (5.0 mm/1h [3.0 mm/1h-11.0 mm/1h] versus 14.0 mm/1h [7.25 mm/1h-18.5 mm/1h]; p=.0007), lower median [IQR] LDH (165 U/L [144 U/L-198 U/L] versus 210 U/L [179 U/L-249 U/L]; p=.0013) and lower median [IQR] troponin levels (0.005 ng/mL [0.003 ng/mL-0.009 ng/mL] versus 0.007 ng/mL [0.006 ng/mL-0.010 ng/mL]; p=.048).

Social distancing, isolation and infection control measures are important for preventing exposure to infection, but insufficient. Aim: The study aimed to evaluate possible role of oral ivermectin as a chemoprophylaxis in asymptomatic family close contacts with COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: A prospective interventional randomised open label-controlled study was conducted (registered at clinicaltrials. gov; NCT04422561) during June and July 2020. Two arms were designed according to use of ivermectin. In ivermectin arm, contacts received ivermectin according to Body Weight (BW) on day of the diagnosis of their index case. The nonintervention group received no treatment. Both groups were followed-up for two weeks for development of symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. Results: Ivermectin group included 203 contacts (to 52 index cases) aged 39.75 +/- 14.94 years; 52.2% were males. Nonintervention group included 101 contacts (to a total of 24 index cases) aged 37.69 +/- 16.96 years, 49.5% were males. Fifteen contacts (7.4%) developed COVID-19 in the ivermectin arm compared to 59 (58.4%) in the nonintervention arm (P <0.001). The protection rate for ivermectin was more prominent in contacts aged less than 60-year-old (6.2% infected compared to 58.7% if no treatment). Ivermectin in the protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection had an OR of 12.533 and 11.445 (compared to nontreatment) in both univariate and multivariate models, respectively. Side effects of ivermectin were reported in 5.4%; they were mild. Conclusion: Ivermectin is suggested to be a promising, effective and safe chemoprophylactic drug in management of COVID-19.","[Shoumann, Waheed M.; Nafae, Ramadan M.; Ragab, Moustafa, I; Samra, Saad R.; Ibrahim, Dalia Anas; AL-Mahrouky, Tarek H.; Sileem, Ashraf E.] Zagazig Univ, Fac Med Zagazig, Dept Chest Med, Al Sharkia, Egypt; [Hegazy, Abdelmonem Awad] Misr Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Med Biotechnol, Coll Biotechnol, 6Th October, Egypt","Hegazy, AA (corresponding author), Misr Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Med Biotechnol, Coll Biotechnol, 6Th October, Egypt.",dr.abdelmonemhegazy@yahoo.com,"Hegazy, Abdelmonem Awad/A-1942-2014","Hegazy, Abdelmonem Awad/0000-0002-5993-6618",,,,26,0,0,4,4,PREMCHAND SHANTIDEVI RESEARCH FOUNDATION,DELHI,"71 JAIN COLONY, VEER NAGAR, DELHI, 110 007, INDIA",2249-782X,0973-709X,,J CLIN DIAGN RES,J.

We describe implementation at the first US site, the UPMC health system, and offer recommendations for implementation at other sites.MethodsTo implement REMAP-COVID, we focused on six major areas: engaging leadership, trial embedment, remote consent and enrollment, regulatory compliance, modification of traditional trial management procedures, and alignment with other COVID-19 studies.ResultsWe recommend aligning institutional and trial goals and sharing a vision of REMAP-COVID implementation as groundwork for learning health system development. Embedment of trial procedures into routine care processes, existing institutional structures, and the electronic health record promotes efficiency and integration of clinical care and clinical research. Remote consent and enrollment can be facilitated by engaging bedside providers and leveraging institutional videoconferencing tools. Coordination with the central institutional review board will expedite the approval process. Protocol adherence, adverse event monitoring, and data collection and export can be facilitated by building electronic health record processes, though implementation can start using traditional clinical trial tools.

As primary and secondary schools once again close in the face of surging infections, there is an opportunity to rigorously study their reopening. School-aged children appear to be less affected by COVID-19 than adults, yet schools may drive community transmission of the virus. Given the impact of school closures on both education and the economy, schools cannot remain closed indefinitely. But when and how can they be reopened safely? We argue that a cluster randomized trial is a rigorous and ethical way to resolve these uncertainties. We discuss key scientific, ethical, and resource considerations both to inform trial design of school reopenings and to prompt discussion of the merits and feasibility of conducting such a trial.","[Weijer, Charles] Western Univ, Dept Med, Western Interdisciplinary Res Bldg,Room 7160, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Weijer, Charles] Western Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Western Interdisciplinary Res Bldg,Room 7160, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Weijer, Charles] Western Univ, Dept Philosophy, Western Interdisciplinary Res Bldg,Room 7160, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Hemming, Karla] Univ Birmingham, Inst Appl Hlth Res, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Phillips Hey, Spencer] Harvard Univ, Harvard Ctr Bioeth, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Fernandez Lynch, Holly] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Med Eth & Hlth Policy, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Fernandez Lynch, Holly] Univ Penn, Leonard Davis Inst Hlth Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Weijer, C (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Med, Western Interdisciplinary Res Bldg,Room 7160, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.; Weijer, C (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Western Interdisciplinary Res Bldg,Room 7160, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.; Weijer, C (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Philosophy, Western Interdisciplinary Res Bldg,Room 7160, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",cweijer@uwo.ca,"Weijer, Charles/ABC-5433-2020","Weijer, Charles/0000-0002-5510-1074; Lynch, Holly/0000-0001-7813-9879",Canadian Institutes of Health Research projectCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [PJT-153045],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by Canadian Institutes of Health Research project under Grant No. PJT-153045.",,34,0,0,3,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1740-7745,1740-7753,,CLIN TRIALS,Clin.

Additional safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines are needed in a timely manner to adequately address the pandemic on an international scale. Such safe and effective vaccines would be especially appealing for international deployment if they also have favorable stability, supply, and potential for implementation in mass vaccination campaigns. Randomized trials provide particularly reliable insights about vaccine efficacy and safety. While enhanced efficiency and interpretability can be obtained from placebo-controlled trials, in settings where their conduct is no longer possible, randomized non-inferiority trials may enable obtaining reliable evaluations of experimental vaccines through direct comparison with active comparator vaccines established to have worthwhile efficacy. Methods: The usual objective of non-inferiority trials is to reliably assess whether the efficacy of an experimental vaccine is not unacceptably worse than that of an active control vaccine previously established to be effective, likely in a placebo-controlled trial. This is formally achieved by ruling out a non-inferiority margin identified to be the minimum threshold for what would constitute an unacceptable loss of efficacy. This article not only investigates non-inferiority margins, denoted by delta, that address the usual objective of determining whether the experimental vaccine is at least similarly effective to the active comparator vaccine in the non-inferiority trial, but also develops non-inferiority margins, denoted by delta(o), intended to address the worldwide need for multiple safe and effective vaccines by satisfying the less stringent requirement that the experimental vaccine be at least similarly effective to an active comparator vaccine having efficacy that satisfies the widely accepted World Health Organization-Food and Drug Administration criteria for worthwhile vaccine efficacy. Results: Using the margin delta enables non-inferiority trials to reliably evaluate experimental vaccines that truly are similarly effective to an active comparator vaccine having any level of worthwhile efficacy. When active comparator vaccines have efficacy in the range of 50%-70%, non-inferiority trials designed to use the margin delta(o) have appealing properties, especially for experimental vaccines having true efficacy of approximately 60%. Conclusion: Non-inferiority trials using the proposed margins may enable reliable randomized evaluations of efficacy and safety of experimental COVID-19 vaccines. Such trials often require approximately two- to three-fold the person-years follow-up than a placebo-controlled trial. This could be achieved, without substantive increases in sample size, by increasing the average duration of follow-up from 2 months to approximately 4-6 months, assuming efficacy of the active comparator vaccine has been reliably evaluated over that longer duration.","[Fleming, Thomas R.] Univ Washington, Dept Biostat, Box 357232, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Krause, Philip R.] FDA, CBER, Off Vaccines Res & Review, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Nason, Martha] NIAID, NIH, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Longini, Ira M.] Univ Florida, Dept Biostat, Gainesville, FL USA; [Henao-Restrepo, Ana-Maria M.] WHO, Geneva, Switzerland","Fleming, TR (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Biostat, Box 357232, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",tfleming@u.washington.edu,,,National Institutes of Health (NIH)/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R37 AI 29168],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The source of financial support for research described in this article, in part, is the National Institutes of Health (NIH)/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) grant entitled ``Statistical Issues in AIDS Research'' (R37 AI 29168).

To compare the effectiveness of a novel genetically engineered recombinant super-compound interferon (rSIFN-co) with traditional interferon-alpha added to baseline antiviral agents (lopinavir-ritonavir or umifenovir) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Method In this multicenter randomized (1:1) trial, patients hospitalized with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 received either rSIFN-co nebulization or interferon-alpha nebulization added to baseline antiviral agents for no more than 28 days. The primary endpoint was the time to clinical improvement. Secondary endpoints included the overall rate of clinical improvement assessed on day 28, the time to radiological improvement and virus nucleic acid negative conversion. Results A total of 94 patients were included in the safety set (46 patients assigned to rSIFN-co group, 48 to interferon-alpha group). The time to clinical improvement was 11.5 days versus 14.0 days (95% CI 1.10 to 2.81, p = .019); the overall rate of clinical improvement on day 28 was 93.5% versus 77.1% (difference, 16.4%; 95% CI 3% to 30%); the time to radiological improvement was 8.0 days versus 10.0 days (p = .002), the time to virus nucleic acid negative conversion was 7.0 days versus 10.0 days (p = .018) in the rSIFN-co and interferon alpha arms, respectively. Adverse events were balanced with no deaths among groups. Conclusions and relevance rSIFN-co was associated with a shorter time of clinical improvement than traditional interferon-alpha in the treatment of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 when combined with baseline antiviral agents. rSIFN-co therapy alone or combined with other antiviral therapy is worth to be further studied. Key messages There are few effective therapies for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) upon the outbreak of the pandemic. Interferon alphas, by inducing both innate and adaptive immune responses, have shown clinical efficacy in treating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. In this multicenter, head-to-head, randomized, clinical trial which included 94 participants with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, the rSIFN-co plus antiviral agents (lopinavir-ritonavir or umifenovir) was associated with a shorter time of clinical improvement than interferon-alpha plus antiviral agents.","[Li, Chuan; Liu, Chengwu; Mei, Jiandong; Deng, Senyi; Zeng, Zhen; Liu, Lunxu] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Dept Thorac Surg, 37 Guoxue Alley, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Luo, Fengming; Wang, Ye; Liu, Dan; Feng, Mei; Li, Weimin] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Dept Pulm & Crit Care Med, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Nian] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Union Hosp, Tongji Med Coll, Dept Neurol, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Nian] Wuhan Red Cross Hosp, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Xu, Zhihua] Mianyang Cent Hosp, Dept Crit Care Med, Mianyang, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wei] Second Mil Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wei; Yu, Chao; Zeng, Jia] Maternal & Child Hlth Hosp Hubei Prov, Dept Infect Dis, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Ming] Publ Hlth Clin Ctr Chengdu, Dept Resp Med, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Yu, Chao] Naval Hosp Eastern Theater PLA, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, Zhoushan, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Jia] Second Mil Med Univ, Naval Med Ctr PLA, Dept Aviat Dis, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Li] Wuhan Red Cross Hosp, Dept Resp Dis, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Li, Duo] Southwest Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Resp Dis, Luzhou, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yanbin] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Ctr Infect Dis, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ruoyang] Sichuan Second Hosp TCM, Dept Resp Dis, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [He, Yuanhong] Publ Hlth Clin Ctr Chengdu, Dept Infect Dis, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Haiyan; Shi, Zhengyu] Publ Hlth Clin Ctr Chengdu, Dept TB, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Duan, Meng] Publ Hlth Clin Ctr Chengdu, Dept Liver Dis, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Kang, Deying] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Dept Evidence Based Med & Clin Epidemiol, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Liao, Jiayu] Univ Calif Riverside, Bourns Coll Engn, Dept Bioengn, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Liao, Jiayu] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, West China California Res Ctr Predict Intervent M, Chengdu, Peoples R China","Liu, LX (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Dept Thorac Surg, 37 Guoxue Alley, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",lunxu_liu@aliyun.com,,"Zhang, Wei/0000-0001-5292-7308","New Coronavirus (2019nCoV) Emergency Project of Sichuan University [2020scunCoVEmergency10001]; Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Epidemic Research Project in West China Hospital, Sichuan University [HX-2019-nCoV016]","This work was supported by the New Coronavirus (2019nCoV) Emergency Project of Sichuan University (No. 2020scunCoVEmergency10001) and the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Epidemic Research Project in West China Hospital, Sichuan University (No. HX-2019-nCoV016).",,40,0,0,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0785-3890,1365-2060,,ANN MED,Ann.

We found significant difficulties in assessing baseline demographics in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines, displaying a lack of transparency in reporting. Further, we found that most of these trials take place in high-income countries, with only 25 of 219 trials (11.4%) taking place in lower middle- or low-income countries. Trials for the current best vaccine candidates (BNT162b2, ChadOx1, mRNA-173) recruited 80.0% White participants. Underrepresentation of BAME groups in medical research will perpetuate historical distrust in healthcare processes, and poses a risk of unknown differences in efficacy and safety of these vaccines by phenotype.

Considering the findings of previous studies on the use of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) for treating severe H1N1 infection and the satisfying results for reducing viral load and mortality, this study aimed to investigate the potential usefulness of IVIg for the management of severe cases. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 84 patients were included: 52 in the IVIg group and 32 in the control group. The intervention group received IVIg at a dose of 400 mg/kg, IV, daily for three days. Both groups received hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and supportive care. The demographic data, mortality rate, the need for mechanical ventilation, length of stay in hospital and in Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and imaging findings were recorded and compared in terms of the mentioned factors. Results: The mean time from admission to IVIg initiation was 3.84 +/- 3.35 days. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of mortality rate (P-value = 0.8) and the need for mechanical ventilation (P-value = 0.39). The length of hospital stay was significantly lower for the control group than that of the intervention group (P-value = 0.003). There was a significant positive relationship between the time from hospital admission to IVIg initiation and the length of stay in the hospital and ICU among the survivors (P-value < 0.001 and =0.01, respectively). Conclusions: Our findings did not support the use of IVIg in combination with hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir in treatment of severe COVID-19 cases.","[Tabarsi, Payam] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Natl Res Inst TB & Lung Dis NRITLD, Clin TB & Epidemiol Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Barati, Saghar; Yousefian, Sahar; Dastan, Farzaneh] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Sch Pharm, Dept Clin Pharm, Rafsanjani Highway,Valiasr Ave, Tehran 615314155, Iran; [Jamaati, Hamidreza; Haseli, Sara; Yousefian, Sahar; Eskandari, Raha; Dastan, Farzaneh] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Natl Res Inst TB & Lung Dis NRITLD, Chron Resp Dis Res Ctr CRDRC, Tehran, Iran; [Marjani, Majid; Abtahian, Zahra] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Masih Daneshvari Hosp, Natl Res Inst TB & Lung Dis NRITLD, Clin TB & Epidemiol Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Moniri, Afshin] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Masih Daneshvari Hosp, Natl Res Inst TB & Lung Dis NRITLD, Virol Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Dastan, Alireza] Univ Calif, Ernest & Julio Gallo Management Program, Sch Engn, Merced, CA USA; [Saffaei, Ali] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Sch Pharm, Dept Clin Pharm, Student Res Comm, Tehran, Iran; [Monjazebi, Fatemeh] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Dept Med Surg Nursing, Tehran, Iran; [Vahedi, Abdolbaset] Shahid Beheshti Med Univ, Masih Daneshvari Hosp, Chron Resp Dis Res Ctr CRDRC, Tehran, Iran","Dastan, F (corresponding author), Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Sch Pharm, Dept Clin Pharm, Rafsanjani Highway,Valiasr Ave, Tehran 615314155, Iran.",fzh.dastan@gmail.com,,,Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences,This study was approved and supported by Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences.,,12,1,1,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1567-5769,1878-1705,,INT IMMUNOPHARMACOL,Int.

Study Design and Methods As part of an RCT, CP was collected per FDA guidelines from individuals recovered from COVID-19 infection. CP donors had to have >= 145 optical density (OD) units (ideal target >= 300) using a semiquantitative, immunochromatographic test for IgG antibody to the nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 (typical range 0-500 OD units). A random subset of samples [14 control plasma, 12 CP medium-anti-NP (145-299 OD units), and 13 CP high anti-NP (>= 300 OD units)] were tested for neutralizing antibodies using an established viral luciferase antibody inhibition assay to detect the infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus that encoded spike protein (SARS2-S-trunc) on a human immunodeficiency virus 1 vector (NL43dEnvNanoLuc), using ACE2-expressing 293 T cells. The titer needed to neutralize 50% of viral activity (NT50) was calculated. Results The uptake of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus by 293T(ACE2) cells was inhibited by pretreatment with CP compared to control CP (p < .001) with control plasma having a median (IQR) 50% neutralization titer (NT50) of 1:28 (1:16,1:36) compared to 1:334 (1:130,1:1295) and 1:324 (1:244,1:578), for medium anti-NP and high anti-NP CP units, respectively. The neutralizing activity of CP met minimum FDA criteria with neutralizing antibody titers >1:80 in 100% of randomly selected samples, using a conservative approach that excluded non-specific binding. Discussion Plasma from donors screened using an immunochromatographic test for IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 NP exhibited neutralizing activity meeting FDA's minimum standard in all randomly selected COVID-19 CP units.","[Freedenberg, Alex T.; Romeiser, Jamie L.; Bennett-Guerrero, Elliott] SUNY Stony Brook, Med Ctr, Dept Anesthesiol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Pan, Chun-Hao; Diehl, William E.; Hwang, Ga-Ram; Leiton, Cindy V.; Shroyer, Kenneth R.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Pathol, Med Ctr, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Muecksch, Frauke] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Retrovirol, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA","Bennett-Guerrero, E (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Med Ctr, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat Qual & Safety, Stony Brook, NY 11733 USA.",elliott.bennett-guerrero@stonybrookmedicine.edu,,"Pan, Chun-Hao/0000-0002-0776-9408",,,,19,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0041-1132,1537-2995,,TRANSFUSION,Transfusion,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/trf.16283,,FEB 2021,7,Hematology,Hematology,QJ2DH,WOS:000619499500001,33448402,Bronze,,,2021-03-31,

Methods: In this randomized, open-label, parallel-arm, multicenter, phase 3 trial, adults (18-75 years) with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 and mild-to-moderate symptoms (including asymptomatic) were randomized 1:1 to oral favipiravir (day 1: 1800 mg BID and days 2-14: 800 mg BID) plus standard supportive care versus supportive care alone. The primary endpoint was time to the cessation of viral shedding; time to clinical cure was also measured. Results: From May 14 to July 3, 2020, 150 patients were randomized to favipiravir (n = 75) or control (n = 75). Median time to the cessation of viral shedding was 5 days (95% CI: 4 days, 7 days) versus 7 days (95% CI: 5 days, 8 days), P = 0.129, and median time to clinical cure was 3 days (95% CI: 3 days, 4 days) versus 5 days (95% CI: 4 days, 6 days), P = 0.030, for favipiravir and control, respectively. Adverse events were observed in 36% of favipiravir and 8% of control patients. One control patient died due to worsening disease. Conclusion: The lack of statistical significance on the primary endpoint was confounded by limitations of the RT-PCR assay. Significant improvement in time to clinical cure suggests favipiravir may be beneficial in mild-to-moderate COVID-19. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

Prospective data regarding this approach from randomised trials is lacking. In the PET NECK study, 564 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck receiving definitive chemoradiation were randomised to either planned neck dissection or PET CT scan guided surveillance. In this surgical trial, three radiotherapy fractionation schedules delivered over 7, 6 or 4 weeks were permitted with synchronous chemotherapy. The purpose of this study was to determine efficacy and quality of life outcomes associated with the use of these schedules. Primary local control and overall survival in addition to quality of life measures at immediately post treatment and 6, 12 and 24 months post-treatment were compared between the three fractionation cohorts. In the 525 patients where fractionation data was available, 181 (34%), 288 (55%) and 56 (11%) patients received 68-70 Gy in 34-35 fractions (#), 60-66 Gy in 30# and 55 Gy in 20# respectively. At a minimum follow up of two years following treatment there was no significant difference between the three fractionation schemes in local control, overall survival or any quality of life measure. Despite the obvious limitations of this study, some data is provided to support the use of hypofractionated accelerated chemoradiation to avoid delays in cancer treatment and reduce hospital visits during the peak of a pandemic. Data from on-going randomised trials examining hypofractionated chemoradiation may be useful for selecting fractionation schedules during future pandemics.","[Vreugdenhil, M.; Fong, Charles; Sanghera, Paul; Hartley, Andrew; Mehanna, Hisham] Univ Birmingham, Inst Head & Neck Studies & Educ, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Vreugdenhil, M.; Fong, Charles; Sanghera, Paul; Hartley, Andrew] Queen Elizabeth Hosp, Hall Edwards Radiotherapy Res Grp, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Dunn, Janet] Univ Warwick, Warwick Clin Trials Unit, Coventry, W Midlands, England","Hartley, A (corresponding author), Queen Elizabeth Hosp, Hall Edwards Radiotherapy Res Grp, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",andrew.hartley@uhb.nhs.uk,,"Mehanna, Hisham/0000-0002-5544-6224",National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment ProgrammeNational Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [06/302/129]; Cancer Research UKCancer Research UK [C19677/A9674],"The original PET neck study was supported by academic grants from the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme (06/302/129) and Cancer Research UK (C19677/A9674),",,36,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1368-8375,1879-0593,,ORAL ONCOL,Oral Oncol.,FEB,2021,113,,,,,,,,105112,10.1016/j.oraloncology.2020.105112,,,6,"Oncology; Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine","Oncology; Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine",QI3QP,WOS:000618894700008,33321287,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2021-03-31,

Using a large online sample from Canada and the United States, we will examine the effect of a three-week prosocial intervention on two indicators of emotional well-being (happiness and the belief that one's life is valuable) and mental health (anxiety and depression). Respondents will be randomly assigned to perform prosocial, self-focused, or neutral behaviors each week. Two weeks after the intervention, a final survey will assess whether the intervention has a lasting effect on mental health and emotional well-being.

Here, we report preliminary results on the efficacy and safety of Gam-COVID-Vac from the interim analysis of this phase 3 trial. Methods We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at 25 hospitals and polyclinics in Moscow, Russia. We included participants aged at least 18 years, with negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR and IgG and IgM tests, no infectious diseases in the 14 days before enrolment, and no other vaccinations in the 30 days before enrolment. Participants were randomly assigned (3:1) to receive vaccine or placebo, with stratification by age group. Investigators, participants, and all study staff were masked to group assignment. The vaccine was administered (0.5 mL/dose) intramuscularly in a prime-boost regimen: a 21-day interval between the first dose (rAd26) and the second dose (rAd5), both vectors carrying the gene for the full-length SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein S. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 from day 21 after receiving the first dose. All analyses excluded participants with protocol violations: the primary outcome was assessed in participants who had received two doses of vaccine or placebo, serious adverse events were assessed in all participants who had received at least one dose at the time of database lock, and rare adverse events were assessed in all participants who had received two doses and for whom all available data were verified in the case report form at the time of database lock. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04530396). Findings Between Sept 7 and Nov 24, 2020, 21 977 adults were randomly assigned to the vaccine group (n=16 501) or the placebo group (n=5476). 19 866 received two doses of vaccine or placebo and were included in the primary outcome analysis. From 21 days after the first dose of vaccine (the day of dose 2), 16 (0.1%) of 14 964 participants in the vaccine group and 62 (1.3%) of 4902 in the placebo group were confirmed to have COVID-19; vaccine efficacy was 91.6% (95% CI 85.6-95.2). Most reported adverse events were grade 1 (7485 [94.0%] of 7966 total events). 45 (0.3%) of 16 427 participants in the vaccine group and 23 (0.4%) of 5435 participants in the placebo group had serious adverse events; none were considered associated with vaccination, with confirmation from the independent data monitoring committee. Four deaths were reported during the study (three [<0.1%] of 16 427 participants in the vaccine group and one [<0.1%] of 5435 participants in the placebo group), none of which were considered related to the vaccine. Interpretation This interim analysis of the phase 3 trial of Gam-COVID-Vac showed 91.6% efficacy against COVID-19 and was well tolerated in a large cohort. Copyright (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods Our study is a phase 1, randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial at a specialised clinical trials centre in Australia. We enrolled healthy adult volunteers in two age groups: younger adults (aged 18-54 years) and older adults (aged 55-75 years). Participants were randomly allocated either vaccine or placebo using a list prepared by the study funder. Participants were to receive two doses of SCB-2019 (either 3 mu g, 9 mu g, or 30 mu g) or a placebo (0.9% NaCl) 21 days apart. SCB-2019 either had no adjuvant (S-Trimer protein alone) or was adjuvanted with AS03 or CpG/Alum. The assigned treatment was administered in opaque syringes to maintain masking of assignments. Reactogenicity was assessed for 7 days after each vaccination. Humoral responses were measured as SCB-2019 binding IgG antibodies and ACE2-competitive blocking IgG antibodies by ELISA and as neutralising antibodies by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 microneutralisation assay. Cellular responses to pooled S-protein peptides were measured by flow-cytometric intracellular cytokine staining. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04405908; this is an interim analysis and the study is continuing. Findings Between June 19 and Sept 23, 2020, 151 volunteers were enrolled; three people withdrew, two for personal reasons and one with an unrelated serious adverse event (pituitary adenoma). 148 participants had at least 4 weeks of follow-up after dose two and were included in this analysis (database lock, Oct 23, 2020). Vaccination was well tolerated, with two grade 3 solicited adverse events (pain in 9 mu g AS03-adjuvanted and 9 mu g CpG/Alum-adjuvanted groups). Most local adverse events were mild injection-site pain, and local events were more frequent with SCB-2019 formulations containing AS03 adjuvant (44-69%) than with those containing CpG/Alum adjuvant (6-44%) or no adjuvant (3-13%). Systemic adverse events were more frequent in younger adults (38%) than in older adults (17%) after the first dose but increased to similar levels in both age groups after the second dose (30% in older and 34% in younger adults). SCB-2019 with no adjuvant elicited minimal immune responses (three seroconversions by day 50), but SCB-2019 with fixed doses of either AS03 or CpG/Alum adjuvants induced high titres and seroconversion rates of binding and neutralising antibodies in both younger and older adults (anti-SCB-2019 IgG antibody geometric mean titres at day 36 were 1567-4452 with AS03 and 174-2440 with CpG/Alum). Titres in all AS03 dose groups and the CpG/Alum 30 mu g group were higher than were those recorded in a panel of convalescent serum samples from patients with COVID-19. Both adjuvanted SCB-2019 formulations elicited T-helper-1-biased CD4(+) T-cell responses. Interpretation The SCB-2019 vaccine, comprising S-Trimer protein formulated with either AS03 or CpG/Alum adjuvants, elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, with high viral neutralising activity. Both adjuvanted vaccine formulations were well tolerated and are suitable for further clinical development. Copyright (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, it is important to seek for ways to increase the resilience and alleviate the psychological pressure of the patients who are quarantined due to infection with COVID-19. The present study was conducted to assess an online multimedia psychoeducational intervention regarding the feasibility, adherence, patient satisfaction and effectiveness on resilience and perceived stress of patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19. Method: This was a pilot cluster randomized parallel-controlled trial with hospital wards as the units of randomization. Participants in this fully online trial were 50 consecutive patients who were hospitalized in 2 hospitals in Shiraz, after being diagnosed with COVID-19. Before the beginning of the intervention, four inpatient wards inside two of the hospitals were randomly assigned to either intervention or control conditions. All eligible participants in the wards allocated to the intervention condition received online multimedia psychoeducational interventions during the 2 weeks, whilst the patients in the wards allocated to the control condition were offered the opportunity to receive telephone-based psychological counseling if needed. Psychoeducational interventions mainly included cognitive-behavioural techniques, stress management techniques, mindfulness-based stress reduction and positive psychotherapy. The patients were assessed regarding resilience and perceived stress at baseline and after two weeks. Results: Of 27 patients starting multimedia psychoeducational interventions, 26 (96.29%) completed post-assessments. A high level of adherence (80.76%) and satisfaction (Mean = 29.42; SD = 4.18) with the online multimedia psychoeducational interventions was found. Compared with the control group, the patients who used online multimedia psychoeducational interventions reported greater resilience (Mean(intervention) = 81.74; Mean(control) = 72.86; adjusted t (46) = 2.10; p = 0.04; CI: 0.39 to 17.38; dppc2 = 0.83) and fewer perceived stress (Mean(intervention) = 22.15; Mean(control) = 29.45; adjusted t (46) = 2.66; p = 0.01; CI: - 12.81 to - 1.78; dppc2 = - 0.77) after 2 weeks. Discussion: The findings of the present study provided a successful first attempt at implementing feasible online multimedia psychoeducational interventions to promote resilience and mitigate stress among the patients who were hospitalized due to infection with COVID-19.

The trial has been extended from the original 12- to 24-month follow-up, using study coordinator-initiated telephone visits. TAILOR-PCI Digital Study tests the feasibility of extending the trial follow-up in a subset of patients for up to 24 months using state-of-the-art digital solutions. The rationale, design, and approach of extended digital study of patients recruited into a large, international, multi-center clinical trial has not been previously described. Methods A total of 930 patients from U.S. and Canadian sites previously enrolled in the 5,302 patient TAILOR-PCI trial within 23 months of randomization are invited by mail to the Digital Study website (http://tailorpci.eurekaplatform.org) and by up to 2 recruiting telephone calls. Eureka, a direct-to-participant digital research platform, is used to consent and collect prospective data on patients for the digital study. Patients are asked to answer health-related surveys at fixed intervals using the Eureka mobile app and or desktop platform. The likelihood of patients enrolled in a randomized clinical trial transitioning to a registry using digital technology, the reasons for nonparticipation and engagement rates are evaluated. To capture hospitalizations, patients may optionally enable geofencing, a process that allows background location tracking and triggering of surveys if a hospital visit greater than 4 hours is detected. In addition, patients answer digital hospitalization sur veys every month. Hospitalization data received from the Digital Study will be compared to data collected from study coordinator telephone visits during the same time frame. Conclusions The TAILOR-PCI Digital Study evaluates the feasibility of transitioning a large multicenter randomized clinical trial to a digital registry. The study could provide evidence for the ability of digital technology to follow clinical trial patients and to ascertain trial-related events thus also building the foundation for conducting digital clinical trials. Such a digital approach may be especially pertinent in the era of COVID-19.","[Pereira, Naveen L.; Byrne, Julia; Lennon, Ryan J.; Murthy, Vishakantha; Rihal, Charanjit; Bailey, Kent] Mayo Clin, Dept Cardiovasc Dis, 200 Frist St,SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Avram, Robert; Pletcher, Mark J.; Marcus, Gregory M.; Olgin, Jeffrey E.] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [So, Derek Y.] Univ Ottawa, Heart Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Iturriaga, Erin; Geller, Nancy; Rosenberg, Yves] NIH, NHLBI, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Goodman, Shaun G.] Univ Toronto, St Michaels Hosp, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Goodman, Shaun G.] Univ Alberta, Canadian VIGOUR Ctr, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Farkouh, Michael E.] Peter Munk Cardiac Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada","Pereira, NL (corresponding author), Mayo Clin, Dept Cardiovasc Dis, 200 Frist St,SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.",pereira.naveen@mayo.edu,,"Marcus, Gregory/0000-0001-5197-7696","National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute -National Institute of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [3U01HL128606-03S1, U01 HL128606, U2CEB021881]; Fonds de la recherche en sante du QuebecFonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec [274831]","This work was funded by a grant from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute -National Institute of Health (NLP and JEO: 3U01HL128606-03S1; NLP: U01 HL128606); (JEO, MJP, GMM: U2CEB021881).

Several lines of evidence suggest a potential role for CV therapies in COVID-19 treatment. Characteristics of clinical trials of CV therapies related to COVID-19 registered on ClinicalTrials.gov have not been described. Methods ClinicalTrials.gov was queried on August 7, 2020 for COVID-19 related trials. Studies evaluating established CV drugs, other fibrinolytics (defibrotide), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were included. Studies evaluating antimicrobial, convalescent plasma, non-colchicine anti-inflammatory, and other therapies were excluded. Trial characteristics were tabulated from study-specific entries. Results A total of 2,935 studies related to COVID-19 were registered as of August 7, 2020. Of these, 1,645 were interventional studies, and the final analytic cohort consisted of 114 studies evaluating 10 CV therapeutic categories. Antithrombotics (32.5%; n = 37) were most commonly evaluated, followed by pulmonary vasodilators (14.0%; n = 16), reninangiotensin-aldosterone system-related therapies (12.3%; n = 14), and colchicine (8.8%; n = 10). Trials evaluating multiple CV therapy categories and CV therapies in combination with non-CV therapies encompassed 4.4% (n = 5) and 9.6% (n = 11) of studies, respectively. Most studies were designed for randomized allocation (87.7%; n = 100), enrollment of less than 1000 participants (86.8%; n = 99), single site implementation (55.3%; n = 63), and had a primary outcome of mortality or a composite including mortality (56.1%; n = 64). Most study populations consisted of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (81.6%; n = 93). At the time of database query, 28.9% (n = 33) of studies were not yet recruiting and the majority were estimated to be completed after December 2020 (67.8%; n = 78). Most lead sponsors were located in North America (43.9%; n = 50) or Europe (36.0%; n = 41). Conclusions A minority (7%) of clinical trials related to COVID-19 registered on ClinicalTrials.gov plan to evaluate CV therapies. Of CV therapy studies, most were planned to be single center, enroll less than 1000 inpatients, sponsored by European or North American academic institutions, and estimated to complete after December 2020. Collectively, these findings underscore the need for a network of sites with a platform protocol for rapid evaluation of multiple therapies and generalizability to inform clinical care and health policy for COVID-19 moving forward.","[Varshney, Anubodh S.; Bhatt, Ankeet S.; Blood, Alexander; Sharkawi, Musa A.; Siddiqi, Hasan K.; Vaduganathan, Muthiah; Mehra, Mandeep R.; Bhatt, Deepak L.; Kochar, Ajar] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Heart & Vasc Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Varshney, Anubodh S.; Wang, David E.; Bhatt, Ankeet S.; Blood, Alexander; Sharkawi, Musa A.; Siddiqi, Hasan K.; Vaduganathan, Muthiah; Mehra, Mandeep R.; Bhatt, Deepak L.; Kochar, Ajar] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wang, David E.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Monteleone, Peter P.] Univ Texas Austin, Seton Heart Inst, Dell Sch Med, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Patel, Manesh R.; Jones, W.

OBJECTIVE To determine whether a layperson-delivered, empathy-focused program of telephone calls could rapidly improve loneliness, depression, and anxiety in at-risk adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From July 6 to September 24, 2020, we recruited and followed up 240 adults who were assigned to receive calls (intervention group) or no calls (control group) via block randomization. Loneliness, depression, and anxiety were measured using validated scales at enrollment and after 4 weeks. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted. Meals on Wheels Central Texas (MOWCTX) clients received calls in their homes or wherever they might have been when the call was received. The study included MOWCTX clients who fit their service criteria, including being homebound and expressing a need for food. A total of 296 participants were screened, of whom 240 were randomized to intervention or control. INTERVENTIONS Sixteen callers, aged 17 to 23 years, were briefly trained in empathetic conversational techniques. Each called 6 to 9 participants over 4 weeks daily for the first 5 days, after which clients could choose to drop down to fewer calls but no less than 2 calls a week. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was loneliness (3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale, range 3-9; and 6-item De Jong Giervald Loneliness [De Jong] Scale, range 0-6). Secondary outcomes were depression (Personal Health Questionnaire for Depression), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale), and self-rated health (Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire). RESULTS The 240 participants were aged 27 to 101 years, with 63% aged at least 65 years (n = 149 of 232), 56% living alone (n = 135 of 240), 79% women (n = 190 of 240), 39% Black or African American (n = 94 of 240), and 22% Hispanic or Latino (n = 52 of 240), and all reported at least 1 chronic condition. Of 240 participants enrolled, 13 were lost to follow-up in the intervention arm and 1 in the control arm. Postassessment differences between intervention and control after 4 weeks showed an improvement of 1.1 on the UCLA Loneliness Scale (95% CI, 0.5-1.7; P < .001; Cohen d of 0.48), and improvement of 0.32 on De Jong (95% CI, -0.20 to 0.81; P = .06; Cohen d, 0.17) for loneliness; an improvement of 1.5 on the Personal Health Questionnaire for Depression (95% CI, 0.22-2.7; P < .001; Cohen d, 0.31) for depression; and an improvement of 1.8 on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (95% CI, 0.44 to 3.2; P < .001; Cohen d, 0.35) for anxiety. General physical health on the Short Form Health Questionnaire Survey showed no change, but mental health improved by 2.6 (95% CI, 0.81 to 4.4; P = .003; Cohen d of 0.46). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A layperson-delivered, empathy-oriented telephone call program reduced loneliness, depression, and anxiety compared with the control group and improved the general mental health of participants within 4 weeks. Future research can determine whether effects on depression and anxiety can be extended to maximize clinical relevance.","[Kahlon, Maninder K.; Aksan, Nazan; Aubrey, Rhonda; Cowley-Morillo, Maria; Jacobs, Elizabeth A.; Sebastian, Katherine R.] Univ Texas Austin, Dell Med Sch, 1501 Red River St, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Jacobs, Elizabeth A.] Univ Texas Austin, Dell Med Sch, Maine Med Ctr Res Inst, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Mundhenk, Rhonda] Lone Star Circle Care, Georgetown, TX USA; [Tomlinson, Steven] Seminary Southwest, Austin, TX USA","Kahlon, MK (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dell Med Sch, 1501 Red River St, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",mkahlon@austin.utexas.edu,,,"Dell Medical School, University of Texas at Austin; Episcopal Health Foundation, Houston, Texas","Funding came from Dell Medical School, University of Texas at Austin and from the Episcopal Health Foundation, Houston, Texas.",,20,0,0,5,5,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",2168-622X,2168-6238,,JAMA PSYCHIAT,JAMA Psychiatry,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.0113,,FEB 2021,7,Psychiatry,Psychiatry,QM6UJ,WOS:000621912000001,33620417,"Other Gold, Green Published",,,2021-03-31,

Minimal data are available from adequately powered randomized, controlled trials. METHODS We randomly assigned hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia in a 2:1 ratio to receive convalescent plasma or placebo. The primary outcome was the patient's clinical status 30 days after the intervention, as measured on a six-point ordinal scale ranging from total recovery to death. RESULTS A total of 228 patients were assigned to receive convalescent plasma and 105 to receive placebo. The median time from the onset of symptoms to enrollment in the trial was 8 days (interquartile range, 5 to 10), and hypoxemia was the most frequent severity criterion for enrollment. The infused convalescent plasma had a median titer of 1:3200 of total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (interquartile range, 1:800 to 1:3200). No patients were lost to follow-up. At day 30 day, no significant difference was noted between the convalescent plasma group and the placebo group in the distribution of clinical outcomes according to the ordinal scale (odds ratio, 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 1.35; P = 0.46). Overall mortality was 10.96% in the convalescent plasma group and 11.43% in the placebo group, for a risk difference of -0.46 percentage points (95% CI, -7.8 to 6.8). Total SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers tended to be higher in the convalescent plasma group at day 2 after the intervention. Adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS No significant differences were observed in clinical status or overall mortality between patients treated with convalescent plasma and those who received placebo.","[Simonovich, V.

In response, drug regulatory agencies and public health bodies have issued guidance on how to assess potential impacts on ongoing clinical trials and stress the importance of a risk-assessment as a pre-requisite for modifications to the clinical trial conduct. This article presents a simulation study to assess the impact on the power of an ongoing clinical trial without the need to unblind trial data and compromise trial integrity. In the context of the CANNA-TICS trial, investigating the effect of nabiximols on reducing the total tic score of the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS-TTS) in patients with chronic tic disorders and Tourette syndrome, the impact of the two COVID-19 related intercurrent events handled by a treatment policy strategy is investigated using a multiplicative and additive data generating model. The empirical power is examined for the analysis of the YGTSS-TTS as a continuous and dichotomized endpoint using analysis techniques adjusted and unadjusted for the occurrence of the intercurrent event. In the investigated scenarios, the simulation studies showed that substantial power losses are possible, potentially making sample size increases necessary to retain sufficient power. However, we were also able to identify scenarios with only limited loss of power. By adjusting for the occurrence of the intercurrent event, the power loss could be diminished to different degrees in most scenarios. In summary, the presented risk assessment approach may support decisions on trial modifications like sample size increases, while maintaining trial integrity.","[Lasch, Florian; Mueller-Vahl, Kirsten; Koch, Armin] Hannover Med Sch, Hannover, Germany; [Guizzaro, Lorenzo] European Med Agcy, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Guizzaro, Lorenzo] Univ Campania, Naples, Italy; [Davila, Lukas Aguirre] Paul Ehrlich Inst, Langen, Germany","Lasch, F (corresponding author), Hannover Med Sch, Hannover, Germany.",lasch.florian@mh-hannover.de,,"Koch, Armin/0000-0003-1401-3219; Lasch, Florian/0000-0002-4889-0212",Medizinische Hochschule Hannover,Medizinische Hochschule Hannover,,31,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1539-1604,1539-1612,,PHARM STAT,Pharm.

There are limited data on participant demographic characteristics in vaccine trials despite the importance of these data to current trials aimed at preventing coronavirus disease 2019. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether racial/ethnic minority groups and female and older adults are underrepresented among participants in vaccine clinical trials. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study examined data from completed US-based vaccine trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov from July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2020. The terms vaccine, vaccination, immunization, and inoculation were used to identify trials. Only those addressing vaccine immunogenicity or efficacy of preventative vaccines were included. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The numbers and percentages of racial/ethnic minority, female, and older individuals compared with US census data from 2011 and 2018. Secondary outcome measures were inclusion by trial phase and year of completion. RESULTS A total of 230 US-based trials with 219 555 participants were included in the study. Most trials were randomized (180 [78.3%]), included viral vaccinations (159 [69.1%]), and represented all trial phases. Every trial reported age and sex; 134 (58.3%) reported race and 79 (34.3%) reported ethnicity. Overall, among adult study participants, White individuals were overrepresented (77.9%; 95% CI, 77.4%-78.4%), and Black or African American individuals (10.6%; 95% CI, 10.2%-11.0%) and American Indian or Alaska Native individuals (0.4%; 95% CI, 0.3%-0.5%) were underrepresented compared with US census data; enrollment of Asian individuals was similar (5.7%; 95% CI, 5.5%-6.0%). Enrollment of Hispanic or Latino individuals (11.6%; 95% CI, 11.1%-12.0%) was also low even among the limited number of adult trials reporting ethnicity. Adult trials were composed of more female participants (75 325 [56.0%]), but among those reporting age as a percentage, enrollment of participants who were aged 65 years or older was low (12.1%; 95% CI, 12.0%-12.3%). Black or African American participants (10.1%; 95% CI, 9.7%-10.6%) and Hispanic or Latino participants (22.5%; 95% CI, 21.6%-23.4%) were also underrepresented in pediatric trials. Among trials reporting race/ethnicity, 65 (48.5%) did not include American Indian or Alaska Native participants and 81 (60.4%) did not include Hawaiian or Pacific Islander participants. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This cross-sectional study found that among US-based vaccine clinical trials, members of racial/ethnic minority groups and older adults were underrepresented, whereas female adults were overrepresented. These findings suggest that diversity enrollment targets should be included for all vaccine trials targeting epidemiologically important infections.","[Andrasik, Michele P.; Krantz, Elizabeth M.; Pergam, Steven A.] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Vaccine & Infect Dis Div, 100 Fairview Ave,NE4-100, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Flores, Laura E.] Univ Nebraska Med Ctr, Coll Allied Hlth Profess, Omaha, NE USA; [Frontera, Walter R.] Univ Puerto Rico, Sch Med, Dept Phys Med Rehabil & Sports Med, San Juan, PR 00936 USA; [Frontera, Walter R.] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Physiol, Sch Med, San Juan, PR 00936 USA; [Del Rio, Carlos] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Atlanta, GA USA; [Del Rio, Carlos] Emory Univ, Hubert Dept Global Hlth, Rollin Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Mondriguez-Gonzalez, Antonio] Univ Cent Caribe, Bayamon, PR USA; [Price, Stephanie A.] Hellen Keller Int, New York, NY USA; [Silver, Julie K.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Silver, Julie K.] Spaulding Rehabil Hosp, Charlestown, MA USA; [Silver, Julie K.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Silver, Julie K.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Pergam, SA (corresponding author), Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Vaccine & Infect Dis Div, 100 Fairview Ave,NE4-100, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.; Silver, JK (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, 300 1st Ave, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA.",spergam@fredhutch.org; julie_silver@hms.harvard.edu,"Pergam, Steven A/C-2286-2008; del Rio, Carlos/B-3763-2012","Pergam, Steven A/0000-0002-6333-5196; del Rio, Carlos/0000-0002-0153-3517",,,,51,0,0,1,1,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",2574-3805,,,JAMA NETW OPEN,JAMA Netw.

Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial that in vitro studies have shown action against SARS-CoV-2, which is why it has been the target of clinical studies with conflicting results. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to assess the association of hydroxychloroquine use with the virological cure, clinical recovery, mortality, and development of adverse effects in patients with COVID-19. PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Lilacs were searched until 7 January 2021, for randomized clinical trials with COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. Of the 130 studies found, 12 met the inclusion criteria. Compared to the patient's control group, the risk ratio (RR) for the virological cure and clinical recovery with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine use was 1.04 (95%CI 0.91-1.17) and 1.03 (95%CI 0.92-1.13), respectively. Hydroxychloroquine (with or without azithromycin) was also not associated with mortality (RR = 1.09, 95%CI 0.98-1.20). Treatment with hydroxychloroquine was associated with any adverse effects (RR = 1.50, 95%CI 1.18-1.81). Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine use did not have a significant effect on virological cure, the time of clinical recovery, and improvement in survival in COVID-19 patients. However, patients who used hydroxychloroquine showed an increase in adverse effects.","[Bignardi, Paulo Roberto; Vengrus, Carolina Santos; Aquino, Bruno Matos; Cerci Neto, Alcindo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Parana, Sch Med, 485 Jockey Club Ave Vila Hip, BR-86072360 Londrina, Parana, Brazil; [Cerci Neto, Alcindo] Univ Estadual Londrina, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Med, Sect Pulmonol, Londrina, Parana, Brazil","Bignardi, PR (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Parana, Sch Med, 485 Jockey Club Ave Vila Hip, BR-86072360 Londrina, Parana, Brazil.",pbignardi@gmail.com,"Bignardi, Paulo/AAH-9399-2021","Bignardi, Paulo/0000-0002-4730-0946",,,,36,0,0,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2047-7724,2047-7732,,PATHOG GLOB HEALTH,Pathog.

In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy of adding high-dose intravenous vitamin C (HDIVC) to the regimens for patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Methods An open-label, randomized, and controlled trial was conducted on patients with severe COVID-19 infection. The case and control treatment groups each consisted of 30 patients. The control group received lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine and the case group received HDIVC (6 g daily) added to the same regimen. Results There were no statistically significant differences between two groups with respect to age and gender, laboratory results, and underlying diseases. The mean body temperature was significantly lower in the case group on the 3rd day of hospitalization (p = 0.001). Peripheral capillary oxygen saturations (SpO(2)) measured at the 3rd day of hospitalization was also higher in the case group receiving HDIVC (p = 0.014). The median length of hospitalization in the case group was significantly longer than the control group (8.5 days vs. 6.5 days) (p = 0.028). There was no significant difference in SpO(2) levels at discharge time, the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and mortality between the two groups. Conclusions We did not find significantly better outcomes in the group who were treated with HDIVC in addition to the main treatment regimen at discharge.

We performed a phase 2 trial to assess the efficacy and safety of human umbilical cord-mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) to treat severe COVID-19 patients with lung damage, based on our phase 1 data. In this randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial, we recruited 101 severe COVID-19 patients with lung damage. They were randomly assigned at a 2:1 ratio to receive either UC-MSCs (4 x 10(7) cells per infusion) or placebo on day 0, 3, and 6. The primary endpoint was an altered proportion of whole lung lesion volumes from baseline to day 28. Other imaging outcomes, 6-minute walk test (6-MWT), maximum vital capacity, diffusing capacity, and adverse events were recorded and analyzed. In all, 100 COVID-19 patients were finally received either UC-MSCs (n = 65) or placebo (n = 35). UC-MSCs administration exerted numerical improvement in whole lung lesion volume from baseline to day 28 compared with the placebo (the median difference was -13.31%, 95% CI -29.14%, 2.13%, P = 0.080). UC-MSCs significantly reduced the proportions of solid component lesion volume compared with the placebo (median difference: -15.45%; 95% CI -30.82%, -0.39%; P = 0.043). The 6-MWT showed an increased distance in patients treated with UC-MSCs (difference: 27.00 m; 95% CI 0.00, 57.00; P = 0.057). The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups. These results suggest that UC-MSCs treatment is a safe and potentially effective therapeutic approach for COVID-19 patients with lung damage. A phase 3 trial is required to evaluate effects on reducing mortality and preventing long-term pulmonary disability. (Funded by The National Key R&D Program of China and others.

We hypothesize that continuation of RAAS inhibition will be superior to temporary discontinuation with regards to the primary endpoint of a global rank sum score. The global rank sum score has been successfully used in previous cardiovascular clinical trials. Trial design: This is an open label parallel two arm (1,1 ratio) randomized control superiority trial of approximately 40 COVID-19 patients who are on chronic RAAS inhibitor therapy. Participants: Adults who are admitted to hospital within the McGill University Health Centre systems (MUHC) including Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH), Montreal General Hospital (MGH) and Jewish General Hospital (JGH) and who are within 96 hours of COVID-19 diagnosis (confirmed via PCR on any biological sample) will be considered for the trial. Of note, the initial protocol to screen and enrol within 48 hours of COVID-19 diagnosis was extended through an amendment, to 96 hours to increase feasibility. Participants have to be 18 years or older and would have to be on RAAS inhibitors for at least a month to be considered eligible for the study. Additionally, RAAS inhibitors should not have been held for more than 48 hours before randomization. A list of inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in the full protocol document. In order to prevent heart failure exacerbation, patients with reduced ejection fraction were excluded from the trial. Once a patient is admitted on the ward with a diagnosis of COVID-19, we will confirm with the treating physician if the participant is suitable for the RAAS-COVID trial and meets all the inclusion and exclusion criteria. If the patient is eligible and informed consent has been obtained we will collect data on sex, age, ethnicity, past medical history and list of medications (e.g. other anti-hypertensives or anticoagulants), for further analysis. Intervention and comparator: All the study participants will be randomized to a strategy of temporarily holding the RAAS inhibitor [intervention] versus continuing the RAAS inhibitor [continued standard of care]. Among participants who are randomized to the intervention arm, alternative guide-line directed anti-hypertensive medication will be provided to the treating physician team (detail in study protocol). In the intervention arm RAAS inhibitor will be withheld for a total of 7 days with the possibility of the withdrawn medication being initiated at any point after day 7 or on the day of discharge. The recommendation for re-initiating the withdrawn medication will be made to the treating physician. The re-initiation of these therapies are according to standard convention and follow-up as per Canadian guidelines. Additionally, the date of restarting the withdrawn medication or whether the medication was re-prescribed on discharge or not, will be collected. This will be used to conduct a sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, biomarkers such as troponin, c-reactive protein (CRP) and lymphocyte count will be assessed during the same time period. Samples will be collected on randomization, day 4 and day 7. Main outcomesPrimary endpoint: In this study the primary end point is a global rank score calculated for all participants, regardless of treatment assignment (score from 0 to 7). Please refer to table 4 in the full protocol. In the context of the current trial, it is estimated that death is the most meaningful endpoint, and therefore has the highest score (score of 7). This is followed by admission to ICU, the need for mechanical ventilation etc. The lowest scores (score of 1) are assigned to biomarker changes (e.g. change in troponin, change in CRP). This strategy has been used successfully in cardiovascular disease trials and therefore is applicable to the current trial. The primary endpoint for the present trial is assessed from baseline to day 7 (or discharge). Participants are ranked across the clinical and biomarker domains. Lower values indicate better health (or stability). Participants who died during the 7th day of the study will be ranked based on all events occurring before their death and also including the fatal event in the score. Next, participants who did not die but were transferred to ICU for invasive ventilation will be ranked based on all the events occurring before the ICU entry and also including the ICU admission in the score. Those participants who did not die were not transferred to ICU for invasive ventilation, will be ranked based on the subsequent outcomes. The mean rank score will then be compared between groups. In this scheme, a lower mean rank score indicates greater overall stability for participants. Secondary endpoints : The key secondary endpoints are the individual components of the primary components and include the following: death, transfer to ICU primarily for invasive ventilation, transfer to ICU for other indication, non-fatal MACE (any of following, MI, stroke, acute HF, new onset Afib), length of stay > 4 days, development of acute kidney injury (> 40% decline in eGFR or doubling of serum creatinine), urgent intravenous treatment for high blood pressure, 30% increase in baseline high sensitivity troponin, 30% increase in baseline BNP, increase in CRP to > 30% in 48 hours and lymphocyte count drop> 30%. We will also look at the World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale for clinical improvement (in COVID-19) in our data. In this scale death will be assigned the highest score of 8. Patients with no limitation of activity will be assigned a score of 1 which indicates overall more stability (3). Additionally, we will evaluate the potential effects of discontinuing RAAS inhibition on alternative schedules (longer/shorter than 7 days, intermittent discontinuation) using a mechanistic mathematical model of COVID-19 immunopathology calibrated to data collected from our patient cohort. In particular, we will assess the impact of alternative schedules on primary and secondary endpoints including increases to baseline CRP and lymphocyte counts. Randomization: Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be performed within an electronic database system at the time of enrolment using a random number generator, an approach that has been successfully used in other clinical trials. Neither participant, study team, or treating team will be blinded to the intervention arm. Blinding: This is an open label study with no blinding.

They are dependent on caregivers and have experienced recent acute illnesses. Among SNF patients, the rate of mortality or acute care use is over 50% within 90 days of discharge, yet these patients and their caregivers often do not receive the quality of transitional care that prepares them to manage serious illnesses at home. Methods The study will test the efficacy of Connect-Home, a successfully piloted transitional care intervention targeting seriously ill SNF patients discharged to home and their caregivers. The study setting will be SNFs in North Carolina, USA, and, following discharge, in patients' home. Using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design, six SNFs will transition at randomly assigned intervals from standard discharge planning to the Connect-Home intervention. The SNFs will contribute data for patients (N = 360) and their caregivers (N = 360), during both the standard discharge planning and Connect-Home time periods. Connect-Home is a two-step intervention: (a) SNF staff create an individualized Transition Plan of Care to manage the patient's illness at home; and (b) a Connect-Home Activation RN visits the patient's home to implement the written Transition Plan of Care. A key feature of the trial includes training of the SNF and Home Care Agency staff to complete the transition plan rather than using study interventionists. The primary outcomes will be patient preparedness for discharge and caregiver preparedness for caregiving role. With the proposed sample and using a two-sided test at the 5% significance level, we have 80% power to detect a 18% increase in the patient's preparedness for discharge score. We will employ linear mixed models to compare observations between intervention and usual care periods to assess primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include (a) patients' quality of life, functional status, and days of acute care use and (b) caregivers' burden and distress. Discussion Study results will determine the efficacy of an intervention using existing clinical staff to (a) improve transitional care for seriously ill SNF patients and their caregivers, (b) prevent avoidable days of acute care use in a population with persistent risks from chronic conditions, and (c) advance the science of transitional care within end-of-life and palliative care trajectories of SNF patients and their caregivers. While this study protocol was being implemented, the COVID-19 pandemic occurred and this protocol was revised to mitigate COVID-related risks of patients, their caregivers, SNF staff, and the study team. Thus, this paper includes additional material describing these modifications.","[Toles, M.; Covington, J.] Univ N Carolina, Sch Nursing, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Colon-Emeric, C.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Durham, NC USA; [Colon-Emeric, C.] Duke Univ, Durham VA GRECC, Durham, NC USA; [Hanson, L.

Methods The study was a multicentric open-label trial of COVID-19 patients who were aged >= 18 years, receiving oxygen without mechanical ventilation, and with evidence of systemic inflammatory response who were assigned to standard of care (SOC) or SOC plus intravenous MP (40 mg bid for 3 days followed by 20 mg bid for 3 days). The primary outcome was a composite of death, admission to the intensive care unit, or requirement for noninvasive ventilation. Both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses were performed. Results A total of 91 patients were screened, and 64 were randomized (mean age70 +/- 12 years). In the ITT analysis, 14 of 29 patients (48%) in the SOC group and 14 of 35 (40%) in the MP group suffered the composite endpoint (40% versus 20% in patients under 72 years and 67% versus 48% in those over 72 years; p = 0.25). In the PP analysis, patients on MP had a significantly lower risk of experiencing the composite endpoint (age-adjusted risk ratio 0.42; 95% confidence interval, CI 0.20-0.89; p = 0.043). Conclusion The planned sample size was not achieved, and our results should therefore be interpreted with caution. The use of MP had no significant effect on the primary endpoint in ITT analysis; however, the PP analysis showed a beneficial effect due to MP, which consistent with other published trials support the use of glucocorticoids in severe cases of COVID-19.","[Corral-Gudino, Luis] Univ Valladolid, Hosp Rio Hortega, Serv Med Interna, Valladolid, Spain; [Bahamonde, Alberto; Hernandez-Blanco, Fernando] Hosp Bierzo, Serv Med Interna, Ponferrada, Spain; [Arnaiz-Revillas, Francisco; Farinas, Maria Carmen] Univ Cantabria, IDIVAL, Hosp UM Valdecilla, Serv Enfermedades Infecciosas, Santander, Spain; [Gomez-Barquero, Julia; Abadia-Otero, Jesica] Univ Valladolid, Hosp Rio Hortega, Serv Med Interna, Consulta Enfermedades Infecciosas, Valladolid, Spain; [Garcia-Ibarbia, Carmen; Hernandez, Jose L.; Olmos, Jose M.; Riancho, Jose A.] Univ Cantabria, IDIVAL, Hosp UM Valdecilla, Serv Med Interna, Santander, Spain; [Mora, Victor; Cifrian, Jose M.] Univ Cantabria, IDIVAL, Hosp UM Valdecilla, Serv Neumol, Santander, Spain; [Cerezo-Hernandez, Ana; Lopez-Muniz, Graciela] Hosp Univ Rio Hortega, Serv Neumol, Valladolid, Spain; [Carrascosa, Miguel] Hosp Laredo, Serv Med Interna, Laredo, Spain; [Nieto, Luis] Hosp Sierrallana, Serv Med Interna, Torrelavega, Spain","Corral-Gudino, L (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, Hosp Rio Hortega, Serv Med Interna, Valladolid, Spain.; Riancho, JA (corresponding author), Univ Cantabria, IDIVAL, Hosp UM Valdecilla, Serv Med Interna, Santander, Spain.",lcorral@saludcastillayleon.es; Abahamonde@saludcastillayleon.es; Francisco.arnaizlasrevillas@scsalud.es; Gomezb@saludcastillayleon.es; Jabadiao@saludcastillayleon.es; Carmen.garciai@scsalud.es; Victormanuel.mora@scsalud.es; Acerezoh@saludcastillayleon.es; Joseluis.hernandez@scsalud.es; Glopezm@saludcastillayleon.es; Fhblanco@saludcastillayleon.es; Josemanuel.cifrian@scsalud.es; Josemanuel.olmos@scsalud.es; Miguel.carrascosa@scsalud.es; Luishta@telefonica.net; Mcarmen.farinas@scsalud.es; joseantonio.riancho@scsalud.es,,,,,,29,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0043-5325,1613-7671,,WIEN KLIN WOCHENSCHR,Wien.

Our aim was to describe the planning of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in terms of timing related to the course of the COVID-19 epidemic and research question evaluated. Study Design and Setting: We performed a living mapping of RCTs registered in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We systematically search the platform every week for all RCTs evaluating preventive interventions and treatments for COVID-19 and created a publicly available interactive mapping tool at https://covid-nma.com to visualize all trials registered. Results: By August 12, 2020, 1,568 trials for COVID-19 were registered worldwide. Overall, the median ([Q1 -Q3]; range) delay between the first case recorded in each country and the first RCT registered was 47 days ([33-67]; 15-163). For the 9 countries with the highest number of trials registered, most trials were registered after the peak of the epidemic (from 100% trials in Italy to 38% in the United States). Most trials evaluated treatments (1,333 trials; 85%); only 223 (14%) evaluated preventive strategies and 12 postacute period intervention. A total of 254 trials were planned to assess different regimens of hydroxychloroquine with an expected sample size of 110,883 patients. Conclusion: This living mapping analysis showed that COVID-19 trials have relatively small sample size with certain redundancy in research questions. Most trials were registered when the first peak of the pandemic has passed. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Design We present the results of a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of colchicine for the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19, with 75 patients allocated 1:1 from 11 April to 30 August 2020. Colchicine regimen was 0.5 mg thrice daily for 5 days, then 0.5 mg twice daily for 5 days. The primary endpoints were the need for supplemental oxygen, time of hospitalisation, need for admission and length of stay in intensive care unit and death rate. Results Seventy-two patients (36 for placebo and 36 for colchicine) completed the study. Median (and IQR) time of need for supplemental oxygen was 4.0 (2.0-6.0) days for the colchicine group and 6.5 (4.0-9.0) days for the placebo group (p<0.001). Median (IQR) time of hospitalisation was 7.0 (5.0-9.0) days for the colchicine group and 9.0 (7.0-12.0) days for the placebo group (p=0.003). At day 2, 67% versus 86% of patients maintained the need for supplemental oxygen, while at day 7, the values were 9% versus 42%, in the colchicine and the placebo groups, respectively (log rank; p=0.001). Two patients died, both in placebo group. Diarrhoea was more frequent in the colchicine group (p=0.26). Conclusion Colchicine reduced the length of both, supplemental oxygen therapy and hospitalisation. The drug was safe and well tolerated. Once death was an uncommon event, it is not possible to ensure that colchicine reduced mortality of COVID-19.","[Lopes, Maria Isabel; Bonjorno, Leticia P.; Giannini, Marcela C.; Amaral, Natalia B.; Menezes, Pamella Indira; Dib, Saulo Musse; Gigante, Samara Libich; Benatti, Maira N.; Rezek, Uebe C.; Emrich-Filho, Laerte L.; Sousa, Betania A.

J,"Hanisch, M; Rake, B",,,,"Hanisch, Marvin; Rake, Bastian",,,Repurposing without purpose? Early innovation responses to the COVID-19 crisis: Evidence from clinical trials,R & D MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article; Early Access,,,,,,,,"The novel coronavirus has created one of the biggest social and economic challenges in recent decades. Since a critical issue in overcoming a large-scale pandemic involves finding effective treatments for the disease, there is typically urgent pressure on the health-care sector to develop innovations to combat the pandemic. Recently, scholars have argued that repurposing - that is, reusing an existing innovation in a different context - allows for such rapid innovation responses and can reduce costs, as the groundwork has already been laid. In this paper, we compare these benefits with the considerable disadvantages associated with innovation repurposing, including lowered barriers to entry, which can lead to declining average quality and duplicate work. Using data on 2,456 COVID-19-related clinical trials initiated between December 2019 and July 2020, we find that merely one-third of the trials actually investigated drugs or vaccines, whereas the rest focused on diagnostics and crisis management issues. In the trials concerning drug testing, we find that drug repurposing is a predominant innovation strategy, but many trials tested the same (combination of) drugs. This indicates an inefficient use of resources and reductions in the average variety and novelty of clinical trials. Furthermore, the small percentage of biopharmaceutical firms involved in the search for COVID-19 treatments raises the question of whether firms may have insufficient incentives to redirect innovation efforts to respond to the pandemic. Our paper contributes to crisis management research, the nascent debate on COVID-19, and the emerging literature on innovation repurposing.","[Hanisch, Marvin] Univ Groningen, Dept Innovat Management & Strategy, Nettelbosje 2, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands; [Rake, Bastian] Maynooth Univ, Sch Business, Maynooth, Co Kildare, Ireland","Hanisch, M (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Dept Innovat Management & Strategy, Nettelbosje 2, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands.",m.hanisch@rug.nl; bastian.rake@mu.ie,,,,,,63,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0033-6807,1467-9310,,R&D MANAGE,R D Manage.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/radm.12461,,FEB 2021,17,Business; Management,Business & Economics,QJ0GI,WOS:000619368000001,,Other Gold,,,2021-03-31,
J,,,,,,,WHO Solidarity Trial Consortium,Repurposed Antiviral Drugs for Covid-19-Interim WHO Solidarity Trial Results,NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The authors report interim results of the WHO Solidarity trial of four repurposed antiviral drugs - remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and interferon beta-1a - in patients hospitalized with Covid-19. Effects on overall mortality, initiation of ventilation, and duration of hospital stay are compared. Background World Health Organization expert groups recommended mortality trials of four repurposed antiviral drugs - remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and interferon beta-1a - in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Methods We randomly assigned inpatients with Covid-19 equally between one of the trial drug regimens that was locally available and open control (up to five options, four active and the local standard of care). The intention-to-treat primary analyses examined in-hospital mortality in the four pairwise comparisons of each trial drug and its control (drug available but patient assigned to the same care without that drug). Rate ratios for death were calculated with stratification according to age and status regarding mechanical ventilation at trial entry. Results At 405 hospitals in 30 countries, 11,330 adults underwent randomization; 2750 were assigned to receive remdesivir, 954 to hydroxychloroquine, 1411 to lopinavir (without interferon), 2063 to interferon (including 651 to interferon plus lopinavir), and 4088 to no trial drug. Adherence was 94 to 96% midway through treatment, with 2 to 6% crossover. In total, 1253 deaths were reported (median day of death, day 8; interquartile range, 4 to 14). The Kaplan-Meier 28-day mortality was 11.8% (39.0% if the patient was already receiving ventilation at randomization and 9.5% otherwise). Death occurred in 301 of 2743 patients receiving remdesivir and in 303 of 2708 receiving its control (rate ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81 to 1.11; P=0.50), in 104 of 947 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and in 84 of 906 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.59; P=0.23), in 148 of 1399 patients receiving lopinavir and in 146 of 1372 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.25; P=0.97), and in 243 of 2050 patients receiving interferon and in 216 of 2050 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.39; P=0.11). No drug definitely reduced mortality, overall or in any subgroup, or reduced initiation of ventilation or hospitalization duration. Conclusions These remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and interferon regimens had little or no effect on hospitalized patients with Covid-19, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation, and duration of hospital stay.

Design We present the results of a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of colchicine for the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19, with 75 patients allocated 1:1 from 11 April to 30 August 2020. Colchicine regimen was 0.5 mg thrice daily for 5 days, then 0.5 mg twice daily for 5 days. The primary endpoints were the need for supplemental oxygen, time of hospitalisation, need for admission and length of stay in intensive care unit and death rate. Results Seventy-two patients (36 for placebo and 36 for colchicine) completed the study. Median (and IQR) time of need for supplemental oxygen was 4.0 (2.0-6.0) days for the colchicine group and 6.5 (4.0-9.0) days for the placebo group (p<0.001). Median (IQR) time of hospitalisation was 7.0 (5.0-9.0) days for the colchicine group and 9.0 (7.0-12.0) days for the placebo group (p=0.003). At day 2, 67% versus 86% of patients maintained the need for supplemental oxygen, while at day 7, the values were 9% versus 42%, in the colchicine and the placebo groups, respectively (log rank; p=0.001). Two patients died, both in placebo group. Diarrhoea was more frequent in the colchicine group (p=0.26). Conclusion Colchicine reduced the length of both, supplemental oxygen therapy and hospitalisation. The drug was safe and well tolerated. Once death was an uncommon event, it is not possible to ensure that colchicine reduced mortality of COVID-19.","[Lopes, Maria Isabel; Bonjorno, Leticia P.; Giannini, Marcela C.; Amaral, Natalia B.; Menezes, Pamella Indira; Dib, Saulo Musse; Gigante, Samara Libich; Benatti, Maira N.; Rezek, Uebe C.; Emrich-Filho, Laerte L.; Sousa, Betania A.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of a single high dose of vitamin D-3 on hospital length of stay in patients with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 2 sites in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The study included 240 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who were moderately to severely ill at the time of enrollment from June 2, 2020, to August 27, 2020. The final follow-up was on October 7, 2020. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single oral dose of 200 000 IU of vitamin D-3 (n = 120) or placebo (n = 120). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was length of stay, defined as the time from the date of randomization to hospital discharge. Prespecified secondary outcomes included mortality during hospitalization; the number of patients admitted to the intensive care unit; the number of patients who required mechanical ventilation and the duration of mechanical ventilation; and serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, total calcium, creatinine, and C-reactive protein. RESULTS Of 240 randomized patients, 237 were included in the primary analysis (mean [SD] age, 56.2 [14.4] years; 104 [43.9%] women; mean [SD] baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, 20.9 [9.2] ng/mL). Median (interquartile range) length of stay was not significantly different between the vitamin D-3 (7.0 [4.0-10.0] days) and placebo groups (7.0 [5.0-13.0] days) (log-rank P = .59; unadjusted hazard ratio for hospital discharge, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.82-1.39]; P = .62). The difference between the vitamin D-3 group and the placebo group was not significant for in-hospital mortality (7.6% vs 5.1%; difference, 2.5% [95% CI, -4.1% to 9.2%]; P = .43), admission to the intensive care unit (16.0% vs 21.2%; difference, -5.2% [95% CI, -15.1% to 4.7%]; P = .30), or need for mechanical ventilation (7.6% vs 14.4%; difference, -6.8% [95% CI, -15.1% to 1.2%]; P = .09). Mean serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D significantly increased after a single dose of vitamin D-3 vs placebo (44.4 ng/mL vs 19.8 ng/mL; difference, 24.1 ng/mL [95% CI, 19.5-28.7]; P < .001). There were no adverse events, but an episode of vomiting was associated with the intervention. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, a single high dose of vitamin D-3, compared with placebo, did not significantly reduce hospital length of stay. The findings do not support the use of a high dose of vitamin D-3 for treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19.","[Murai, Igor H.; Fernandes, Alan L.; Sales, Lucas P.; Duran, Camila S.

OBJECTIVE To examine whether high-dose zinc and/or high-dose ascorbic acid reduce the severity or duration of symptoms compared with usual care among ambulatory patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This multicenter, single health system randomized clinical factorial open-label trial enrolled 214 adult patients with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed with a polymerase chain reaction assay who received outpatient care in sites in Ohio and Florida. The trial was conducted from April 27, 2020, to October 14, 2020. INTERVENTION Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio to receive either 10 days of zinc gluconate (50 mg), ascorbic acid (8000 mg), both agents, or standard of care. OUTCOMES The primary end point was the number of days required to reach a 50% reduction in symptoms, including severity of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue (rated on a 4-point scale for each symptom). Secondary end points included days required to reach a total symptom severity score of 0, cumulative severity score at day 5, hospitalizations, deaths, adjunctive prescribed medications, and adverse effects of the study supplements. RESULTS A total of 214 patients were randomized, with a mean (SD) age of 45.2 (14.6) years and 132 (61.7%) women. The study was stopped for a low conditional power for benefit with no significant difference among the 4 groups for the primary end point. Patients who received usual care without supplementation achieved a 50% reduction in symptoms at a mean (SD) of 6.7 (4.4) days compared with 5.5 (3.7) days for the ascorbic acid group, 5.9 (4.9) days for the zinc gluconate group, and 5.5 (3.4) days for the group receiving both (overall P = .45). There was no significant difference in secondary outcomes among the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this randomized clinical trial of ambulatory patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, treatment with high-dose zinc gluconate, ascorbic acid, or a combination of the 2 supplements did not significantly decrease the duration of symptoms compared with standard of care.","[Thomas, Suma; Patel, Divyang; Bittel, Barbara; Wolski, Kathy; Wang, Qiuqing; Kumar, Anirudh; Il'Giovine, Zachary J.; Mehra, Reena; Nissen, Steve E.; Desai, Milind Y.] Cleveland Clin, Heart & Vasc Inst, 9500 Euclid Ave,Desk J1-5, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; [Mehra, Reena] Cleveland Clin, Lerner Res Inst, Neurol Inst, Resp Inst, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [McWilliams, Carla] Cleveland Clin Florida, Dept Infect Dis, Weston, FL USA","Desai, MY (corresponding author), Cleveland Clin, Heart & Vasc Inst, 9500 Euclid Ave,Desk J1-5, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA.",desaim2@ccf.org,,,,,,17,1,1,1,1,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",2574-3805,,,JAMA NETW OPEN,JAMA Netw.

Mortality in these critically ill patients is high. Elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in these severe courses are associated with poor outcome. Extracorporeal cytokine adsorption is an approach to lower elevated IL-6 levels. However, there is no randomised controlled data on the efficacy of cytokine adsorption and its effect on patient outcome in severe COVID-19 related ARDS requiring V-V ECMO support. Methods and analysis We here report the protocol of a 1:1 randomised, controlled, parallel group, open-label intervention, superiority multicentre trial to evaluate the effect of extracorporeal cytokine adsorption using the CytoSorb device in severe COVID-19 related ARDS treated with V-V ECMO. We hypothesise that extracorporeal cytokine adsorption in these patients is effectively reducing IL-6 levels by 75% or more after 72 hours as compared with the baseline measurement and also reducing time to successful V-V ECMO explantation.

Mortality in these critically ill patients is high. Elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in these severe courses are associated with poor outcome. Extracorporeal cytokine adsorption is an approach to lower elevated IL-6 levels. However, there is no randomised controlled data on the efficacy of cytokine adsorption and its effect on patient outcome in severe COVID-19 related ARDS requiring V-V ECMO support. Methods and analysis We here report the protocol of a 1:1 randomised, controlled, parallel group, open-label intervention, superiority multicentre trial to evaluate the effect of extracorporeal cytokine adsorption using the CytoSorb device in severe COVID-19 related ARDS treated with V-V ECMO. We hypothesise that extracorporeal cytokine adsorption in these patients is effectively reducing IL-6 levels by 75% or more after 72 hours as compared with the baseline measurement and also reducing time to successful V-V ECMO explantation.

The idea of using commonly available full-face diving (FFD) masks as a temporary solution was quickly spread across social media. However, it was unknown whether an FFD mask would considerably impair complex surgical tasks. Thus, we aimed to assess laparoscopic surgical performance while wearing an FFD mask as PPE. (2) Methods: In a randomized-controlled cross-over trial, 40 laparoscopically naive medical students performed laparoscopic procedures while wearing an FFD mask with ad hoc 3D-printed connections to heat and moisture exchange (HME) filters vs. wearing a common surgical face mask. The performance was evaluated using global and specific Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) checklists for suturing and cholecystectomy. (3) Results: For the laparoscopic cholecystectomy, both global OSATS scores and specific OSATS scores for the quality of procedure were similar (Group 1: 25 +/- 4.3 and 45.7 +/- 12.9, p = 0.485, vs. Group 2: 24.1 +/- 3.7 and 43.3 +/- 7.6, p = 0.485). For the laparoscopic suturing task, the FFD mask group needed similar times to the surgical mask group (3009 +/- 1694 s vs. 2443 +/- 949 s; p = 0.200). Some participants reported impaired verbal communication while wearing the FFD mask, as it muffled the sound of speech, as well as discomfort in breathing. (4) Conclusions: FFD masks do not affect the quality of laparoscopic surgical performance, despite being uncomfortable, and may therefore be used as a substitute for conventional PPE in times of shortage-i.e., the global COVID-19 pandemic.","[Felinska, Eleni Amelia; Chen, Zi-Wei; Fuchs, Thomas Ewald; Otto, Benjamin; Kenngott, Hannes Gotz; Mueller-Stich, Beat Peter; Nickel, Felix] Heidelberg Univ Hosp, Dept Gen Visceral & Transplant Surg, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Kowalewski, Karl-Friedrich] Heidelberg Univ, Univ Med Ctr Mannheim, Dept Urol & Urol Surg, D-68167 Mannheim, Germany","Nickel, F (corresponding author), Heidelberg Univ Hosp, Dept Gen Visceral & Transplant Surg, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",EleniAmelia.Felinska@med.uni-heidelberg.de; z.chen@stud.uni-heidelberg.de; thomas.fuchs@stud.uni-heidelberg.de; b.otto@stud.uni-heidelberg.de; Hannes.Kenngott@med.uni-heidelberg.de; karl-friedrich.kowalewski@umm.de; beat.mueller@med.uni-heidelberg.de; Felix.Nickel@med.uni-heidelberg.de,,"Felinska, Eleni/0000-0002-3838-1625",,,,18,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0383,,J CLIN MED,J.

Objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid given to the hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: This was a prospective, multicenter, single-blind, randomized control trial. Adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were admitted to the general ward were randomly assigned to either receive methylprednisolone or not for 7 days. The primary end point was the incidence of clinical deterioration 14 days after randomization. Results: We terminated this trial early because the number of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in all the centers decreased in late March. Finally, a total of 86 COVID-19 patients underwent randomization. There was no difference of the incidence of clinical deterioration between the methylprednisolone group and control group (4.8 vs. 4.8%, p = 1.000). The duration of throat viral RNA detectability in the methylprednisolone group was 11 days (interquartile range, 6-16 days), which was significantly longer than that in the control group (8 days [2-12 days], p = 0.030). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in other secondary outcomes. Mass cytometry discovered CD3(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, and NK cells in the methylprednisolone group which were significantly lower than those in the control group after randomization (p < 0.05). Conclusions: From this prematurely closed trial, we found that the short-term early use of corticosteroid could suppress the immune cells, which may prolong severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 shedding in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","[Tang, Xiao; Wu, Xiu-Zhi; Wang, Wen; Shi, Huan-Zhong; Sun, Bing] Capital Med Univ, Beijing Chao Yang Hosp, Beijing Inst Resp Med, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Feng, Ying-Mei; Zhang, Jia-Ying; Jin, Rong-Hua] Capital Med Univ, Beijing You An Hosp, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ni, Ji-Xiang; Su, Jian] China Three Gorges Univ, Peoples Hosp, Yi Chang Peoples Hosp 1, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, Yichang, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Liu, Li-Min; Li, Yu-Lei] Wuhan Univ Sci & Technol, Tianyou Hosp, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Hu, Ke; Zhao, Yang] Wuhan Univ, Renmin Hosp, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ji-Xian; Xie, Jiao] Hubei Prov Hosp Integrated Chinese & Western Med, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jun-Wen; Ding, Zhou] Xiang Yang First Peoples Hosp, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, Xiangyang, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jian-Chu; He, Xin-Liang] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Union Hosp, Tongji Med Coll, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, Huazhong, Peoples R China","Sun, B (corresponding author), Capital Med Univ, Beijing Chao Yang Hosp, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, 8 Gongti Nanlu, Beijing 100020, Peoples R China.",ricusunbing@126.com,,,"Beijing Municipal Administration of Hospitals' Mission Plan, China [SML20150301]; Excellence Program of Beijing Clinical Key Specialty (2018); Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Key Technology Research and Development Funding of Beijing Municipal Administration of Hospitals [COVID-19-BHA03]","This work was supported by the Beijing Municipal Administration of Hospitals' Mission Plan, China (SML20150301), Excellence Program of Beijing Clinical Key Specialty (2018) and Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Key Technology Research and Development Funding of Beijing Municipal Administration of Hospitals (COVID-19-BHA03).",,36,0,0,0,0,KARGER,BASEL,"ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0025-7931,1423-0356,,RESPIRATION,Respiration,FEB,2021,100,2,,,,,116,126,,10.1159/000512063,,JAN 2021,11,Respiratory System,Respiratory System,QM1DC,WOS:000612497600001,33486496,"Bronze, Green Published",,,2021-03-31,

FindingsIn this randomized clinical trial that included 659 patients hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19 and who were taking ACEIs or ARBs before hospital admission, the mean number of days alive and out of the hospital for those assigned to discontinue vs continue these medications was 21.9 vs 22.9, respectively, a difference that was not statistically significant. MeaningThese findings do not support routinely discontinuing ACEIs or ARBs among patients hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19. ImportanceIt is unknown whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have a positive, neutral, or negative effect on clinical outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). ObjectiveTo determine whether discontinuation compared with continuation of ACEIs or ARBs changed the number of days alive and out of the hospital through 30 days. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA randomized clinical trial of 659 patients hospitalized in Brazil with mild to moderate COVID-19 who were taking ACEIs or ARBs prior to hospitalization (enrolled: April 9-June 26, 2020; final follow-up: July 26, 2020). InterventionsDiscontinuation (n=334) or continuation (n=325) of ACEIs or ARBs. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was the number of days alive and out of the hospital through 30 days. Secondary outcomes included death, cardiovascular death, and COVID-19 progression. ResultsAmong 659 patients, the median age was 55.1 years (interquartile range [IQR], 46.1-65.0 years), 14.7% were aged 70 years or older, 40.4% were women, and 100% completed the trial. The median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 6 days (IQR, 4-9 days) and 27.2% of patients had an oxygen saturation of less than 94% of room air at baseline. In terms of clinical severity, 57.1% of patients were considered mild at hospital admission and 42.9% were considered moderate. There was no significant difference in the number of days alive and out of the hospital in patients in the discontinuation group (mean, 21.9 days [SD, 8 days]) vs patients in the continuation group (mean, 22.9 days [SD, 7.1 days]) and the mean ratio was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-1.01). There also was no statistically significant difference in death (2.7% for the discontinuation group vs 2.8% for the continuation group; odds ratio [OR], 0.97 [95% CI, 0.38-2.52]), cardiovascular death (0.6% vs 0.3%, respectively; OR, 1.95 [95% CI, 0.19-42.12]), or COVID-19 progression (38.3% vs 32.3%; OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 0.95-1.80]). The most common adverse events were respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (9.6% in the discontinuation group vs 7.7% in the continuation group), shock requiring vasopressors (8.4% vs 7.1%, respectively), acute myocardial infarction (7.5% vs 4.6%), new or worsening heart failure (4.2% vs 4.9%), and acute kidney failure requiring hemodialysis (3.3% vs 2.8%). Conclusions and RelevanceAmong patients hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19 and who were taking ACEIs or ARBs before hospital admission, there was no significant difference in the mean number of days alive and out of the hospital for those assigned to discontinue vs continue these medications. These findings do not support routinely discontinuing ACEIs or ARBs among patients hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19 if there is an indication for treatment. Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04364893 This randomized clinical trial compares the effect of discontinuing vs continuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) on days alive and out of the hospital at 30 days among patients with COVID-19 taking the drugs prior to hospitalization.","[Lopes, Renato D.; Macedo, Ariane V.

We hypothesised that preoperative intravenous iron and tranexamic acid (TXA) may reduce the transfusion rate in these patients. Methods and analysis The HiFIT study is a multicentre, 2x2 factorial, randomised, double-blinded, controlled trial evaluating the effect of iron isomaltoside (IIM) (20 mg/kg) vs placebo and of TXA (intravenously at inclusion and topically during surgery) versus placebo on transfusion rate during hospitalisation, in patients undergoing emergency surgery for HF and having a preoperative haemoglobin between 95 and 130 g/L. 780 patients are expected. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients receiving an allogenic blood transfusion of packed red blood cells from the day of surgery until hospital discharge (or until D30 if patient is still hospitalised). Enrolment started on March 2017 in 11 French hospitals. The study was stopped between July 2017 and August 2018 (because of investigation of serious AEs with IIM in Spain) and slowed down since March 2020 (COVID-19 crisis). The expected date of final follow-up is May 2022. Analyses of the intent-to-treat and per-protocol populations are planned. Ethics and dissemination The HiFIT trial protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Comite de Protection des Personnes Ouest II and the French authorities (ANSM). It will be carried out according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The results will be disseminated through presentation at scientific conferences and publication in peer-reviewed journals.

Methods We undertook a quasi-experimental study reporting on a 5-month implementation period in 58 primary health care centres from municipal areas within Bogota (Colombia), Mexico City (Mexico), and Lima (Peru). Within the municipal areas, units were randomized to four arms: (1) care as usual (control); (2) training alone; (3) training and municipal support, designed specifically for the study, using a less intensive clinical and training package; and (4) training and municipal support, designed specifically for the study, using a more intense clinical and training package. The primary outcome was the cumulative proportion of consulting adult patients out of the population registered within the centre whose alcohol consumption was measured (coverage). Results The combination of municipal support and training did not result in higher coverage than training alone (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.6 to 0.8). Training alone resulted in higher coverage than no training (IRR = 9.8, 95% CI = 4.1 to 24.7). Coverage did not differ by intensity of the clinical and training package (coefficient = 0.8, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.5). Conclusions Training of providers is key to increasing coverage of alcohol measurement amongst primary health care patients. Although municipal support provided no added value, it is too early to conclude this finding, since full implementation was shortened due to COVID-19 restrictions.","[Anderson, Peter; Llopis, Eva Jane; Mercken, Liesbeth; Kokole, Dasa; Solovei, Adriana; de Vries, Hein] Maastricht Univ, CAPHRI Care & Publ Hlth Res Inst, Dept Hlth Promot, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Anderson, Peter; Rowlands, Gill; O'Donnell, Amy; Kaner, Eileen] Newcastle Univ, Populat Hlth Sci Inst, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Manthey, Jakob; Rehm, Jurgen] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Clin Psychol & Psychotherapy, Dresden, Germany; [Manthey, Jakob; Schulte, Bernd; Schmidt, Christiane] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Ctr Interdisciplinary Addict Res ZIS, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Hamburg, Germany; [Llopis, Eva Jane] Univ Ramon Llull, ESADE, Barcelona, Spain; [Llopis, Eva Jane; Rehm, Jurgen] CAMH, Inst Mental Hlth Policy Res, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Rey, Guillermina Natera; Aguilar, Perla Sonia Medina] Inst Nacl Psiquiatria Ramon de la Fuente Muniz, Ciudad De Mexico, Cdmx, Mexico; [Bustamante, Ines, V; Piazza, Marina] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Sch Publ Hlth & Adm, Lima, Peru; [Mejia-Trujillo, Juliana; Perez-Gomez, Augusto] Corp Nuevos Rumbos, Bogota, Colombia; [Lopez-Pelayo, Hugo; Gual, Antoni] Hosp Clin Barcelona, Psychiat Dept, Addict Unit, Barcelona, Spain; [Lopez-Pelayo, Hugo; Gual, Antoni] Inst Carlos III, Red Trastornos Adict, Madrid, Spain; [Lopez-Pelayo, Hugo; Gual, Antoni] Inst Invest Biomed August Pi i Sunyer IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain; [Rehm, Jurgen] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Rehm, Jurgen] Univ Toronto, Dept Psychiat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Rehm, Jurgen] IM Sechenov First Moscow State Med Univ, Inst Leadership & Hlth Management, Dept Int Hlth Projects, Moscow, Russia","Anderson, P (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Populat Hlth Sci Inst, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",,,,"European Horizon 2020 Programme for research, technological development and demonstration [778048]; Comorbid Depression in Latin America (SCALA); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Instituto de Salud Carlos III through a Juan Rodes contract, FEDER [JR/00025]; Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona; CERCA Programme/Generalitat de Catalunya; Fundacion Gonzalo Rio Arronte A.C.; Hospital Clinic i Universitari de Barcelona","The research leading to these results or outcomes has received funding from the European Horizon 2020 Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under Grant Agreement no. 778048 - Scale-up of Prevention and Management of Alcohol Use Disorders and Comorbid Depression in Latin America (SCALA).

Amongst its provisions, the Act amended the Supreme Court Act 1933 (ACT) to allow judge-alone trials on indictable offences, at the election of a judge. This article assesses the rationale for this amendment, finding that the concerns expressed by the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) legislature that delay in justice would have negative ramifications are merited. The evidence demonstrates that delay in trial proceedings can negatively affect witness memory, prolong victim and witness trauma, and harm defendants through indeterminate incarceration. However, the authors express reticence about the constitutional legality of waiving such a fundamental right through territory legislation. There are multiple constitutional grounds on which the legislation can be challenged, with this article exploring the possible implications of the Kable Doctrine. The authors' comparison to New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria shows that there were more appropriate measures that balanced the swift execution of justice and interests of an accused. The right to trial by a jury of peers is a bedrock of Australian law and the decision to abrogate that right represents a dangerous precedent.",,,Jane.Campbell@legalaidact.org.au,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1034-5329,2206-9542,,CURR ISS CRIM JUSTIC,Curr.

At the time this clinical trial was planned, there were no available vaccine or therapeutic agents with proven efficacy, but the severity of the condition prompted the use of several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. It has long been hypothesized that the use of convalescent plasma (CP) from infected patients who have developed an effective immune response is likely to be an option for the treatment of patients with a variety of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) of viral etiology. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma in adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods/design: The ConPlas-19 study is a multicenter, randomized, open-label controlled trial. The study has been planned to include 278 adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 infection not requiring mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive). Subjects are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio (139 per treatment arm), stratified by center, to receive intravenously administered CP (single infusion) plus SOC or SOC alone, and are to be followed for 30 days. The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients that progress to category 5, 6, or 7 (on the 7-point ordinal scale proposed by the WHO) at day 15. Interim analyses for efficacy and/or futility will be conducted once 20%, 40%, and 60% of the planned sample size are enrolled and complete D15 assessment. Discussion: This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma for the treatment of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The results of this study are expected to contribute to establishing the potential place of CP in the therapeutics for a new viral disease.","[Diago-Sempere, Elena; Sancho-Lopez, Aranzazu; de Diego, Isabel Salcedo; Payares-Herrera, Concepcion; Avendano-Sola, Cristina; Ruiz-Antoran, Belen] Hosp Univ Puerta Hierro Majadahonda, Inst Invest Sanitaria Puerta Hierro Segovia de Ar, Clin Pharmacol Dept, C Manuel de Falla 1, Madrid 28222, Spain; [Bueno, Jose Luis] Hosp Univ Puerta Hierro Majadahonda, Hematol & Hemotherapy Dept, Hemotherapy Unit, Madrid, Spain; [Bueno, Jose Luis] Hosp Univ Puerta Hierro Majadahonda, Hematol & Hemotherapy Dept, Apheresis Unit, Madrid, Spain; [Rubio, Elena Munez; Fernandez-Cruz, Ana; Ramos-Martinez, Antonio] Hosp Univ Puerta Hierro Majadahonda, Infect Dis Unit, Internal Med Dept, Madrid, Spain; [Torres, Ferran] Hosp Clin Barcelona, Med Stat Core Facil IDIBAPS, Clin Pharmacol Dept, Barcelona, Spain; [de Molina, Rosa Malo] Hosp Univ Puerta Hierro Majadahonda, Pneumol Dept, Madrid, Spain; [Velasco-Iglesias, Ana] IIS Puerta Hierro Segovia de Arana, Madrid, Spain; [Flecha, Inmaculada Casas] Inst Salud Carlos III, Ctr Nacl Microbiol, Flu & Resp Virus Unit, Madrid, Spain; [Palomino, Rafael Duarte] Hosp Univ Puerta Hierro Majadahonda, Hematol & Hemotherapy Dept, Madrid, Spain","Sancho-Lopez, A (corresponding author), Hosp Univ Puerta Hierro Majadahonda, Inst Invest Sanitaria Puerta Hierro Segovia de Ar, Clin Pharmacol Dept, C Manuel de Falla 1, Madrid 28222, Spain.",Aranzazu.sancho@salud.madrid.org,"Torres, Ferran/D-1296-2011","Torres, Ferran/0000-0002-7355-7913","Government of Spain, Ministry of Science and Innovation, Instituto de Salud Carlos III [COV20/00072]; European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) A way to make Europe; SCReN (Spanish Clinical Research Network), ISCIII [PT17/0017/0009]","This research is funded by the Government of Spain, Ministry of Science and Innovation, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, grant no COV20/00072 (Royal DecreeLaw 8/2020, of 17 March, on urgent extraordinary measures to deal with the economic and social impact of COVID-19), co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) A way to make Europe, and supported by SCReN (Spanish Clinical Research Network), ISCIII, project PT17/0017/0009.

The putative viral-induced inhibition of ACE2 could result in the defective degradation of bradykinin, a potent inflammatory substance. We hypothesize that increased bradykinin in the lungs is an important mechanism driving the development of pneumonia and respiratory failure in COVID-19. Methods: This is a phase II, single-center, three-armed parallel-group, open-label, active control superiority randomized clinical trial. One hundred eighty eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either the inhibitor of C1e/kallikrein 20 U/kg intravenously on day 1 and day 4 plus standard care; or icatibant 30 mg subcutaneously, three doses/day for 4 days plus standard care; or standard care alone, as recommended in the clinical trials published to date, which includes supplemental oxygen, non-invasive and invasive ventilation, antibiotic agents, anti-inflammatory agents, prophylactic antithrombotic therapy, vasopressor support, and renal replacement therapy. Discussion: Accumulation of bradykinin in the lungs is a common side effect of ACE inhibitors leading to cough. In animal models, the inactivation of ACE2 leads to severe acute pneumonitis in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the inhibition of bradykinin almost completely restores the lung structure. We believe that inhibition of bradykinin in severe COVID-19 patients could reduce the lung inflammatory response, impacting positively on the severity of disease and mortality rates.","[Mansour, Eli; Palma, Andre; Bernardes, Ana Flavia; Ulaf, Raisa G.; Nunes, Thyago A.; Ribeiro, Luciana C.; Santos, Thiago Martins; Trabasso, Plinio; Moretti, Maria Luiza; Velloso, Licio A.] Univ Estadual Campinas, Sch Med Sci, Dept Internal Med, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Bueno, Flavia F.; de Lima-Junior, Jose C.; Monfort-Pires, Milena; Bombassaro, Bruna; Araujo, Eliana P.; Velloso, Licio A.] Univ Estadual Campinas, Obes & Comorbid Res Ctr, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Araujo, Eliana P.] Univ Estadual Campinas, Sch Nursing, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Falcao, Antonio Luis E.] Univ Estadual Campinas, Sch Med Sci, Dept Surg, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Dertkigil, Rachel P.; Dertkigil, Sergio S.] Univ Estadual Campinas, Sch Med Sci, Dept Radiol, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Maia, Rafael P.; Benaglia, Tatiana] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Math Stat & Sci Computat, Dept Stat, Campinas, SP, Brazil","Velloso, LA (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Sch Med Sci, Dept Internal Med, Campinas, SP, Brazil.; Velloso, LA (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Obes & Comorbid Res Ctr, Campinas, SP, Brazil.",lavellos@unicamp.br,"Maia, Rafael Pimentel/F-6942-2012","Maia, Rafael Pimentel/0000-0001-5736-8269","Emergency project-Rapid Implementation of Supplements Against COVID-19 of the Sao Paulo Research Foundation [FAPESP 2020/04522-5]; Research, Innovation and Dissemination Center -Obesity and Comorbidities Research Center of the Sao Paulo Research Foundation [FAPESP 2013/07607-8]; University of Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil","Emergency project-Rapid Implementation of Supplements Against COVID-19 of the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP 2020/04522-5).

This study reported the outcomes, multiple challenges, and broad recommendations associated with the impact of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on oncology early phase 1 trials-and on drug development in Asia-based on the experiences and perspectives of Asian oncology phase 1 centers. Methods: Between March and April 2020 during the initial period of outbreak, the impact of COVID-19 across oncology phase 1 sites in five Asian countries-China (Hong Kong), Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore-was retrospectively analyzed. Results: There was no trial termination or treatment discontinuation in all five countries. Although the most common impact was new patient enrollment being placed on hold, which was based on pharmaceutical sponsors' decision-making, the situation varied per site. Most sites had no restrictions in place that would limit their ability to fully comply with the requirements of conducting the early phase studies. The number of protocol deviations during the pandemic was largely dependent on domestic transportation status during the outbreak rather than the ability of the clinical trial centers. Conclusion: Determining the risk to benefits ratio of patients with cancer who are enrolled in early phase 1 clinical trials under the unusual circumstances of a global pandemic is important. Specific guidance or guidelines on the conduct of early phase 1 clinical trials during public health emergencies that are based on the recent lessons learned is urgently required.","[Shimizu, Toshio; Yamamoto, Noboru] Natl Canc Ctr Hosp, Dept Expt Therapeut, Early Phase 1 Drug Dev Serv, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo City, Tokyo 1040045, Japan; [Kim, Dong-Wan] Seoul Natl Univ Hosp, Clin Trials Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Loong, Herbert H.; Ma, Brigette] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Phase 1 Clin Trial Ctr, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Loong, Herbert H.; Ma, Brigette] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, State Key Lab Translat Oncol, Dept Clin Oncol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lin, Chia-Chi] Natl Taiwan Univ Hosp, Dept Oncol, Phase 1 Ctr, Taipei, Taiwan; [Ng, Matthew C.

Human amniotic products have a broad immune-mediating profile. Observing that many COVID-19 patients have a profound inflammatory response to the virus, we sought to determine the influence of human amniotic fluid (hAF) on hospitalized patients with COVID-19.ResultsA 10-patient case series was IRB-approved to study the impact of hAF on hospitalized patients with documented COVID-19. Nine of the 10 patients survived to discharge, with one patient succumbing to the disease when enrolled on maximal ventilatory support and severe hypoxia. The study design was altered by the IRB such that the last 6 patients received higher dose of intravenous hAF. In this latter group, patients that had observed reductions in C-reactive protein were associated with improved clinical outcomes. No hAF-related adverse events were noted. Acknowledging some of the inherent limitations of this case series, these results inform and catalyze a larger scaled randomized prospective trial to further investigate hAF as a therapy for COVID-19.Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04319731; March 23, 2020","[Selzman, Craig H.; Tonna, Joseph E.; Vargas, Camila; Skidmore, Chloe] Univ Utah, Sch Med, Div Cardiothorac Surg, 3C 127,30 N 1900 E, Salt Lake City, UT 84132 USA; [Pierce, Jan; Phillips, John D.] Univ Utah, Sch Med, Cell Therapy & Regenerat Med Program, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Lewis, Giavonni] Univ Utah, Sch Med, Div Gen Surg, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Hatton, Nathan D.] Univ Utah, Sch Med, Pulm & Criticial Care Med, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Phillips, John D.] Univ Utah, Sch Med, Div Hematol, Salt Lake City, UT USA","Selzman, CH (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Sch Med, Div Cardiothorac Surg, 3C 127,30 N 1900 E, Salt Lake City, UT 84132 USA.",craig.selzman@hsc.utah.edu,,"Selzman, Craig/0000-0001-9218-4764",Divisions of Cardiothoracic Surgery and Hematology,Funding for this project was sourced internally within the Divisions of Cardiothoracic Surgery and Hematology.,,20,0,0,0,0,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1756-0500,,BMC RES NOTES,BMC Res.

Senior medical students are being incrementally deployed to the front line to address the shortage of certified physicians. These students, some of whom will be fast-tracked as physicians, may lack knowledge regarding the initial management of time-critical emergencies such as stroke. Objective: Our aim was to determine whether an e-learning module could improve asynchronous distance knowledge acquisition of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) in senior medical students compared to the traditional didactic video. Methods: A randomized, data analyst-blinded web-based trial was conducted at the University of Geneva Faculty of Medicine between April and June 2020. Fifth year medical students followed a distance learning path designed to teach the NIHSS. The control group followed the traditional didactic video created by Patrick Lyden, while the e-learning group followed the updated version of a previously tested, highly interactive e-learning module. The main outcome was the score on a 50-question quiz displayed upon completion of the learning material. The difference in the proportion of correct answers for each specific NIHSS item was also assessed. Results: Out of 158 potential participants, 88 started their allocated learning path and 75 completed the trial. Participants who followed the e-learning module performed better than those who followed the video (38 correct answers, 95% CI 37-39, vs 35 correct answers, 95% CI 34-36, P<.001). Participants in the e-learning group scored better on five elements than the video group: key NIHSS concepts (P=.02), the consciousness - global item (P<.001), the facial palsy item (P=.04), the ataxia item (P=.03), and the sensory item (P=.04). Conclusions: Compared to the traditional didactic video, a highly interactive e-learning module enhances asynchronous distance learning and NIHSS knowledge acquisition in senior medical students.","[Suppan, Melanie; Savoldelli, Georges Louis] Geneva Univ Hosp, Dept Anaesthesiol Clin Pharmacol Intens Care & Em, Div Anaesthesiol, Geneva, Switzerland; [Suppan, Melanie; Cottet, Philippe; Koka, Avinash; Assal, Frederic; Savoldelli, Georges Louis; Suppan, Laurent] Fac Med, Rue Gabrielle Perret Gentil 4, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Stuby, Loric] Geneve TEAM Ambulances, Geneva, Switzerland; [Carrera, Emmanuel] Univ Geneva, Stroke Ctr, Dept Neurol, Geneva Univ Hosp, Geneva, Switzerland; [Carrera, Emmanuel] Univ Geneva, Fac Med, Geneva, Switzerland; [Cottet, Philippe; Koka, Avinash; Suppan, Laurent] Geneva Univ Hosp, Dept Anaesthesiol Clin Pharmacol Intens Care & Em, Div Emergency Med, Rue Gabrielle Perret Gentil 4, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Assal, Frederic] Geneva Univ Hosp, Dept Clin Neurosci, Cognit Neurol Unit, Neurol, Geneva, Switzerland; [Savoldelli, Georges Louis] Univ Geneva, Fac Med, Unit Dev & Res Med Educ, Geneva, Switzerland","Suppan, L (corresponding author), Fac Med, Rue Gabrielle Perret Gentil 4, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.; Suppan, L (corresponding author), Geneva Univ Hosp, Dept Anaesthesiol Clin Pharmacol Intens Care & Em, Div Emergency Med, Rue Gabrielle Perret Gentil 4, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",laurent.suppan@hcuge.ch,"Suppan, Melanie/AAZ-8097-2020; Suppan, Laurent/AAU-1562-2020","Suppan, Melanie/0000-0002-8807-9619; Suppan, Laurent/0000-0001-6989-6421; Koka, Avinash/0000-0002-3911-0528; Cottet, Philippe/0000-0001-6029-8548; Stuby, Loric/0000-0003-1663-5249",,,,41,2,2,1,1,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",TORONTO,"130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",1438-8871,,,J MED INTERNET RES,J.

We aimed to assess the impact of COVID on acute stroke clinical trial conduct at sites that continued to enroll patients during the pandemic. BEST-MSU is an ongoing study of Mobile Stroke Units (MSU) vs standard management of tPA-eligible acute stroke patients in the pre-hospital setting. MSU personnel include a vascular neurologist via telemedicine, and a nurse, CT technologist, paramedics and emergency medicine technicians on-board. During COVID, consent, 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and EQ5D were obtained by phone instead of in-person, but other aspects of management were similar to the pre-COVID period. We compared patient demographics, study metrics, and infection of study personnel during intra- vs pre-COVID eras. Five of 6 BEST-MSU sites continued to enroll during COVID. There were no differences in intra- (n = 57) vs pre- (n = 869) COVID enrolled tPA eligible patients' age, sex, race (38.6% vs 38.0% Black), ethnicity (15.8% vs 18.6% Hispanic), or NIHSS (median 11 vs 9). The percent of screened patients enrolled and adjudicated tPA eligible declined from 13.6% to 6.6% (p < .001); study enrollment correlated with local stay-at-home and reopening orders. There were no differences in alert to MSU arrival or arrival to tPA times, but MSU on-scene time was 5 min longer (p = .01). There were no differences in ED door to CT, tPA treatment or thrombectomy puncture times, hospital length of stay, discharge disposition, or remote vs in-person 90-day mRS or EQ5D. One MSU nurse tested positive but did not require hospitalization. Clinical research in the pre-hospital setting can be carried out accurately and safely during a pandemic. tPA eligibility rates declined, but otherwise there were no differences in patient demographics, deterioration of study processes, or serious infection of study staff.","[Yamal, Jose-Miguel; Jacob, Asha P.; Wang, Mengxi] UTHealth, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat & Data Sci, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Parker, Stephanie A.; Bowry, Ritvij; Bratina, Patti] UTHealth, Dept Neurol, Houston, TX USA; [Rajan, Suja S.] UTHealth, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Management Policy & Community Hlth, Houston, TX USA; [Nour, May] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Neurol Radiol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Mackey, Jason] Indiana Univ, Dept Neurol, Indianapolis, IN 46204 USA; [Collins, Sarah] Indiana Univ Hlth, Fishers, IN USA; [Jones, William; Schimpf, Brandi; Eisshofer, Michael] Univ Colorado, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Aurora, CO USA; [Ornelas, David] UCHealth, Morrison, CO USA; [Spokoyny, Ilana] Sutter Hlth, Burlingame, CA USA; [Im, Jenny Fung] Mills Peninsula Med Ctr, Dept Neurosci, Burlingame, CA USA; [Im, Jenny Fung] Mills Peninsula Med Ctr, Orthoped Serv, Burlingame, CA USA; [Gilbert, Greg] Emergency Med Syst San Mateo Cty, San Mateo, CA USA; [Grotta, James C.] Mem Hermann Hosp, Clin Innovat & Res Inst, Houston, TX USA","Yamal, JM (corresponding author), UTHealth, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat & Data Sci, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",Jose-Miguel.Yamal@uth.tmc.edu,"Grotta, James/AAH-7423-2021","Yamal, Jose-Miguel/0000-0003-2505-0090",Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute - PCORI [R-1511-33024],"The authors report no conflicts pertaining to this work.

In Germany, AgeWell.de is the first large-scale initiative investigating the effectiveness of a multi-component lifestyle intervention against cognitive decline. We aimed to investigate the recruitment process and baseline characteristics of the AgeWell.de participants to gain an understanding of the at-risk population and who engages in the intervention. General practitioners across five study sites recruited participants (aged 60-77 years, Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia/CAIDE dementia risk score >= 9). Structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with eligible participants, including neuropsychological assessments. We analyzed group differences between (1) eligible vs. non-eligible participants, (2) participants vs. non-participants, and (3) between intervention groups. Of 1176 eligible participants, 146 (12.5%) dropped out before baseline; the study population was thus 1030 individuals. Non-participants did not differ from participants in key sociodemographic factors and dementia risk. Study participants were M = 69.0 (SD = 4.9) years old, and 52.1% were women. The average Montreal Cognitive Assessment/MoCA score was 24.5 (SD = 3.1), indicating a rather mildly cognitively impaired study population; however, 39.4% scored >= 26, thus being cognitively unimpaired. The bandwidth of cognitive states bears the interesting potential for differential trial outcome analyses. However, trial conduction is impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring adjustments to the study protocol with yet unclear methodological consequences.","[Roehr, Susanne; Zulke, Andrea; Luppa, Melanie; Riedel-Heller, Steffi G.] Univ Leipzig, Inst Social Med Occupat Hlth & Publ Hlth ISAP, Med Fac, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Roehr, Susanne] Trinity Coll Dublin, Global Brain Hlth Inst GBHI, Dublin D02 PN40, Ireland; [Brettschneider, Christian; Koenig, Hans-Helmut] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Hlth Econ & Hlth Serv Res, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Weissenborn, Marina; Czock, David; Haefeli, Walter E.] Univ Hosp Heidelberg, Dept Clin Pharmacol & Pharmacoepidemiol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Kuehne, Flora; Zoellinger, Isabel; Gensichen, Jochen] Univ Hosp LMU Munich, Inst Gen Practice Family Med, D-80336 Munich, Germany; [Samos, Franziska-Antonia Zora; Bauer, Alexander; Frese, Thomas] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Gen Practice & Family Med, D-06112 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Doehring, Juliane; Krebs-Hein, Kerstin; Kaduszkiewicz, Hanna] Univ Kiel, Inst Gen Practice, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Oey, Anke; Wiese, Birgitt] Hannover Med Sch, Work Grp Med Stat & IT Infrastruct, Inst Gen Practice, D-30625 Hannover, Germany; [Hoffmann, Wolfgang; Thyrian, Jochen Rene] Univ Med Greifswald, Inst Community Med, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany; [Hoffmann, Wolfgang; Thyrian, Jochen Rene] German Ctr Neurodegenerat Dis DZNE, Site Rostock Greifswald, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany","Rohr, S (corresponding author), Univ Leipzig, Inst Social Med Occupat Hlth & Publ Hlth ISAP, Med Fac, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.; Rohr, S (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Global Brain Hlth Inst GBHI, Dublin D02 PN40, Ireland.",susanne.roehr@medizin.uni-leipzig.de; andrea.zuelke@medizin.uni-leipzig.de; melanie.luppa@medizin.uni-leipzig.de; c.brettschneider@uke.de; marina.weissenborn@med.uni-heidelberg.de; flora.kuehne@med.uni-muenchen.de; isabel.zoellinger@med.uni-muenchen.de; franziska.samos@medizin.uni-halle.de; alexander.bauer@medizin.uni-halle.de; j.doehring@allgemeinmedizin.uni-kiel.de; kkh@allgemeinmedizin.uni-kiel.de; oey.anke@mh-hannover.de; david.czock@med.uni-heidelberg.de; thomas.frese@uk-halle.de; Jochen.Gensichen@med.uni-muenchen.de; walter.emil.haefeli@med.uni-heidelberg.de; wolfgang.hoffmann@uni-greifswald.de; kkh@allgemeinmedizin.uni-kiel.de; h.koenig@uke.de; rene.thyrian@dzne.de; wiese.birgitt@mh-hannover.de; Steffi.Riedel-Heller@medizin.uni-leipzig.de,"Brettschneider, Christian/H-5920-2019","Brettschneider, Christian/0000-0002-5280-1075; Hoffmann, Wolfgang/0000-0002-6359-8797; Roehr, Susanne/0000-0001-9385-0669; Zulke, Andrea/0000-0002-6026-8573; Haefeli, Walter/0000-0003-0672-6876; Czock, David/0000-0003-1217-5134; Kuehne, Flora/0000-0003-3043-3782; Thyrian, Jochen Rene/0000-0001-6889-693X; Samos, Franziska-Antonia Zora/0000-0002-8283-7984","German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01GL1704A, 01GL1704B, 01GL1704C, 01GL1704D, 01GL1704E, 01GL1704F]","This research was funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF; reference numbers: 01GL1704A, 01GL1704B, 01GL1704C, 01GL1704D, 01GL1704E, 01GL1704F).",,41,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Fair and equitable subject selection in clinical trials offering investigational therapies ought to be an urgent moral concern. Subject selection determines the distribution of risks and benefits, and impacts the applicability of the study results for the larger population. While Research Ethics Committees monitor fair subject selection within each trial, no standard oversight exists for subject selection across multiple trials for the same disease. Drawing on the experience of multiple clinical trials at a single academic medical centre in the USA, we posit that concurrent COVID-19 trials are liable to unfair and inequitable subject selection on account of scientific uncertainty, lack of transparency, scarcity and, lastly, structural barriers to equity compounded by implicit bias. To address the critical gap in the current literature and international regulation, we propose new ethical guidelines for research design and conduct that bolsters fair and equitable subject selection. Although the proposed guidelines are tailored to the research design and protocol of concurrent trials in the COVID-19 pandemic, they may have broader relevance to single COVID-19 trials.","[Jansen, Maud O.; Schrantz, Stephen J.] Univ Chicago, Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Angelos, Peter] Univ Chicago, Gen Surg, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Donington, Jessica S.; Madariaga, Maria Lucia L.; Zakrison, Tanya L.] Univ Chicago, Surg, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Zakrison, TL (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Surg, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",tzakrison@surgery.bsd.uchicago.edu,,"Jansen, Maud/0000-0002-0659-4298",,,,22,0,0,2,2,BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND",0306-6800,1473-4257,,J MED ETHICS,J.

Low-intensity internet interventions allow them to benefit from psychological support even when institutional help is not available. Focusing on enhancing psychological resources-self-efficacy and perceived social support-makes an intervention relevant for various occupations within the medical profession. Previously, these resources were found to operate both individually or sequentially with self-efficacy either preceding social support (cultivation process) or following it (enabling process). Objective: The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the efficacy of 4 variants of Med-Stress, a self-guided internet intervention that aims to improve the multifaceted well-being of medical professionals. Methods: This study was conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N=1240) were recruited mainly via media campaigns and social media targeted ads. They were assigned to 1 of the following 4 groups: experimental condition reflecting the cultivation process, experimental condition reflecting the enabling process, active comparator enhancing only self-efficacy, and active comparator enhancing only perceived social support. Outcomes included 5 facets of well-being: job stress, job burnout, work engagement, depression, and job-related traumatic stress. Measurements were taken on the web at baseline (time 1), immediately after intervention (time 2), and at a 6-month follow-up (time 3). To analyze the data, linear mixed effects models were used on the intention-to-treat sample. The trial was partially blinded as the information about the duration of the trial, which was different for experimental and control conditions, was public. Results: At time 2, job stress was lower in the condition reflecting the cultivation process than in the one enhancing social support only (d=-0.21), and at time 3, participants in that experimental condition reported the lowest job stress when compared with all 3 remaining study groups (ds between -0.24 and -0.41). For job-related traumatic stress, we found a significant difference between study groups only at time 3: stress was lower in the experimental condition in which self-efficacy was enhanced first than in the active comparator enhancing solely social support (d=-0.24). The same result was found for work engagement (d=-0.20), which means that it was lower in exactly the same condition that was found beneficial for stress relief. There were no differences between study conditions for burnout and depression neither at time 2 nor at time 3. There was a high dropout in the study (1023/1240, 82.50% at posttest), reflecting the pragmatic nature of this trial. Conclusions: The Med-Stress internet intervention improves some components of well-being-most notably job stress-when activities are completed in a specific sequence. The decrease in work engagement could support the notion of dark side of this phenomenon, but further research is needed.","[Smoktunowicz, Ewelina; Lesnierowska, Magdalena; Cieslak, Roman] SWPS Univ Social Sci & Humanities, Dept Psychol, Warsaw, Poland; [Smoktunowicz, Ewelina; Carlbring, Per] Stockholm Univ, Dept Psychol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Andersson, Gerhard] Linkoping Univ, Dept Behav Sci & Learning, Linkoping, Sweden; [Andersson, Gerhard] Karolinska Inst, Dept Clin Neurosci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Cieslak, Roman] Univ Colorado, Trauma Hlth & Hazards Ctr, Colorado Springs, CO USA","Smoktunowicz, E (corresponding author), SWPS Univ Social Sci & Humanities, Dept Psychol, Warsaw, Poland.",esmoktunowicz@swps.edu.pl,"; Carlbring, Per/D-3628-2009; Andersson, Gerhard/J-8529-2012; Cieslak, Roman/F-3435-2014","Lesnierowska, Magdalena/0000-0003-4095-8865; Carlbring, Per/0000-0002-2172-8813; Smoktunowicz, Ewelina/0000-0002-1748-3876; Andersson, Gerhard/0000-0003-4753-6745; Cieslak, Roman/0000-0002-2413-5343","National Centre for Research and Development in PolandNational Centre for Research & Development, Poland; Central Institute for Labour Protection, National Research Institute in Poland [I.N.16]","The authors are grateful to Malwina Puchalska-Kaminska and Krzysztof Rzenca for their assistance in conducting the preimplementation study.

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in a pooled interim analysis of four trials. Methods This analysis includes data from four ongoing blinded, randomised, controlled trials done across the UK, Brazil, and South Africa. Participants aged 18 years and older were randomly assigned (1:1) to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine or control (meningococcal group A, C, W, and Y conjugate vaccine or saline). Participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group received two doses containing 5 x 10(10) viral particles (standard dose; SD/SD cohort); a subset in the UK trial received a half dose as their first dose (low dose) and a standard dose as their second dose (LD/SD cohort). The primary efficacy analysis included symptomatic COVID-19 in seronegative participants with a nucleic acid amplification test-positive swab more than 14 days after a second dose of vaccine. Participants were analysed according to treatment received, with data cutoff on Nov 4, 2020. Vaccine efficacy was calculated as 1 - relative risk derived from a robust Poisson regression model adjusted for age. Studies are registered at ISRCTN89951424 and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606, NCT04400838, and NCT04444674. Findings Between April 23 and Nov 4, 2020, 23 848 participants were enrolled and 11 636 participants (7548 in the UK, 4088 in Brazil) were included in the interim primary efficacy analysis. In participants who received two standard doses, vaccine efficacy was 62.1% (95% CI 41.0-75.7; 27 [0.6%] of 4440 in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group vs 71 [1.6%] of 4455 in the control group) and in participants who received a low dose followed by a standard dose, efficacy was 90.0% (67.4-97.0; three [0.2%] of 1367 vs 30 [2.2%] of 1374; p(interaction)=0.010). Overall vaccine efficacy across both groups was 70.4% (95.8% CI 54.8-80.6; 30 [0.5%] of 5807 vs 101 [1.7%] of 5829). From 21 days after the first dose, there were ten cases hospitalised for COVID-19, all in the control arm; two were classified as severe COVID-19, including one death. There were 74 341 person-months of safety follow-up (median 3.4 months, IQR 1.3-4.8): 175 severe adverse events occurred in 168 participants, 84 events in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 91 in the control group. Three events were classified as possibly related to a vaccine: one in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, one in the control group, and one in a participant who remains masked to group allocation. Interpretation ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 has an acceptable safety profile and has been found to be efficacious against symptomatic COVID-19 in this interim analysis of ongoing clinical trials.

Methods: Forty-one patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups: artemisinin-piperaquine (AP) (n = 23) and control (n = 18). The primary outcome were the time taken to reach undetectable levels of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the percentage of participants with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 on days 7, 10, 14, and 28. The computed tomography (CT) imaging changes within 10 days, corrected QT interval changes, adverse events, and abnormal laboratory parameters were the secondary outcomes. Results: The mean time to reach undetectable viral RNA (mean +/- standard deviation) was 10.6 +/- 1.1 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.4-12.8) for the AP group and 19.3 +/- 2.1 days (95% CI 15.1-23.5) for the control group. The percentages of patients with undetectable viral RNA on days 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 were 26.1%, 43.5%, 78.3%, 100%, and 100%, respectively, in the AP group and 5.6%, 16.7%, 44.4%, 55.6%, and 72.2%, respectively, in the control group. The CT imaging within 10 days post-treatment showed no significant between-group differences (P > 0.05). Both groups had mild adverse events. Conclusions: In patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, the time to reach undetectable SARS-CoV-2 was significantly shorter in the AP group than that in the control group. However, physicians should consider QT interval changes before using AP. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Intervention programs to prevent e-cigarette initiation administered by authority figures are met with more resistance from youth compared to peer-led programs. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and implementation process of using social network analysis (SNA) to identify student peer leaders in schools and train them to deliver e-cigarette prevention programming to their peers. Nine schools were recruited to participate in the study during the 2019-2020 school year. Schools were assigned to one of three conditions: (1) expert; (2) peer-random (selected peer-leaders would teach to random students); and (3) peer-fixed (selected peer-leaders would teach to assigned students based on nominations). Study participation varied by day due to school attendance, with 686 participants at baseline and 608 at posttest. Almost all students who did not complete the study resulted from the interruption of schools being closed due to COVID-19. Implementation issues fell into three categories: (1) scheduling, (2) day-of logistics, and (3) student group dynamics. Overall, the results showed positive satisfaction among teachers, who unanimously found the program appropriate for the grade-level and that peer-leaders worked well within their groups. Peer-led students-both random and assigned-reported having more fun and willing to tell friends to try the program compared to expert-led students. This study demonstrated the feasibility of implementing a peer-led e-cigarette prevention program for 6th grade students, using SNA to provide intervention rigidity and validity.","[Chu, Kar-Hai; Sidani, Jaime; Matheny, Sara; Rothenberger, Scott D.] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Robertson, Linda] UPMC Hillman Canc Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Miller, Elizabeth] UPMC Childrens Hosp, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Valente, Thomas] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA USA","Chu, KH (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",chuk@pitt.edu,,"Miller, Elizabeth/0000-0002-7266-7766","National Cancer InstituteUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [P30CA047904, K07CA222338]","This project was supported in part by awards P30CA047904 and K07CA222338 from the National Cancer Institute.

These considerations should include how to manufacture billions of doses of high-quality vaccines, support for vaccine purchase, coordination of supply, the equitable distribution of vaccines and the logistics of global vaccine delivery, all of which are a prelude to a massive vaccination campaign targeting people of all ages. Furthermore, additional scientific questions about the vaccines remain that should be answered to improve vaccine efficacy, including questions regarding the optimization of vaccination regimens, booster doses, the correlates of protection, vaccine effectiveness, safety and enhanced surveillance. The timely and coordinated execution of these post-efficacy tasks will bring the pandemic to an effective, and efficient, close.","[Kim, Jerome H.; Marks, Florian; Clemens, John D.] Int Vaccine Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [Marks, Florian] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Inst Therapeut Immunol & Infect Dis, Sch Clin Med, Cambridge, England; [Marks, Florian] Univ Antananarivo, Antananarivo, Madagascar; [Clemens, John D.] Int Ctr Diarrheal Dis Res, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Clemens, John D.] UCLA, Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, Los Angeles, CA USA","Kim, JH (corresponding author), Int Vaccine Inst, Seoul, South Korea.",jerome.kim@ivi.int,,"Kim, Jerome/0000-0003-0461-6438",,,,79,3,3,11,11,NATURE RESEARCH,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",1078-8956,1546-170X,,NAT MED,Nat.

These procedures can be complex, resource-intensive and time-consuming. Some candidate vaccines currently under development for COVID-19 include genetically modified viruses, which may be considered GMOs. Given the public health emergency caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, on July 15, 2020, the European Parliament approved a temporary derogation of the European environmental requirements to facilitate that those clinical trials with GMOs intended to treat or prevent COVID-19 can start as soon as possible in Europe. This measure has been very controversial, since it could entail risks to human health and the environment, and could be seen as unfair for other products targeting unmet medical needs. With the adoption of this measure, the bottlenecks and obstacles for the development of innovative GMO-based medicines in the EU that the environmental legislation entails have become even more evident.

We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine candidate, BBIBP-CorV, in humans. Methods We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 trial at Shangqiu City Liangyuan District Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Henan Province, China. In phase 1, healthy people aged 18-80 years, who were negative for serum-specific IgM/IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at the time of screening, were separated into two age groups (18-59 years and >= 60 years) and randomly assigned to receive vaccine or placebo in a two-dose schedule of 2 mu g, 4 mu g, or 8 mu g on days 0 and 28. In phase 2, healthy adults (aged 18-59 years) were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive vaccine or placebo on a single-dose schedule of 8 mu g on day 0 or on a two-dose schedule of 4 mu g on days 0 and 14,0 and 21, or 0 and 28. Participants within each cohort were randomly assigned by stratified block randomisation (block size eight) and allocated (3:1) to receive vaccine or placebo. Group allocation was concealed from participants, investigators, and outcome assessors. The primary outcomes were safety and tolerability. The secondary outcome was immunogenicity, assessed as the neutralising antibody responses against infectious SARS-CoV-2. This study is registered with www.chictr.org.cn, ChiCTR2000032459. Findings In phase 1,192 participants were enrolled (mean age 53.7 years [SD 15.6]) and were randomly assigned to receive vaccine (2 mu g [n=24], 4 mu g [n=24], or 8 mu g [n=24] for both age groups [18-59 years and >= 60 years]) or placebo (n=24). At least one adverse reaction was reported within the first 7 days of inoculation in 42 (29%) of 144 vaccine recipients. The most common systematic adverse reaction was fever (18-59 years, one [4%] in the 2 mu g group, one [4%] in the 4 mu g group, and two [8%] in the 8 mu g group; >= 60 years, one [4%] in the 8 mu g group). All adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity. No serious adverse event was reported within 28 days post vaccination. Neutralising antibody geometric mean titres were higher at day 42 in the group aged 18-59 years (87.7 [95% CI 64.9-118.6], 2 mu g group; 211.2 [158.9-280.6], 4 mu g group; and 228-7 [186.1-281.1], 8 mu g group) and the group aged 60 years and older (80.7 [65.4-99-6], 2 mu g group; 131.5 [108.2-159.7], 4 mu g group; and 170.87 [133.0-219-5], 8 mu g group) compared with the placebo group (2.0 [2.0-2.0]). In phase 2,448 participants were enrolled (mean age 41.7 years [SD 9.9]) and were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine (8 mu g on day 0 [n=84] or 4 mu g on days 0 and 14 [n=84], days 0 and 21 [n=84], or days 0 and 28 [n=84]) or placebo on the same schedules (n=112). At least one adverse reaction within the first 7 days was reported in 76 (23%) of 336 vaccine recipients (33 [39%], 8 mu g day 0; 18 [21%], 4 mu g days 0 and 14; 15 [18%], 4 mu g days 0 and 21; and ten [12%], 4 mu g days 0 and 28). One placebo recipient in the 4 mu g days 0 and 21 group reported grade 3 fever, but was self-limited and recovered. All other adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity. The most common systematic adverse reaction was fever (one [1%], 8 mu g day 0; one [1%], 4 mu g days 0 and 14; three [4%], 4 mu g days 0 and 21; two [2%], 4 mu g days 0 and 28). The vaccine-elicited neutralising antibody titres on day 28 were significantly greater in the 4 mu g days 0 and 14 (169.5, 95% CI 132.2-217.1), days 0 and 21 (282.7,221.2-361.4), and days 0 and 28 (218.0,181.8-261.3) schedules than the 8 mu g day 0 schedule (14.7,11.6-18.8; all p<0.001). Interpretation The inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBIBP-CorV, is safe and well tolerated at all tested doses in two age groups. Hutnoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 were induced in all vaccine recipients on day 42. Two-dose immunisation with 4 mu g vaccine on days 0 and 21 or days 0 and 28 achieved higher neutralising antibody titres than the single 8 mu g dose or 4 mu g dose on days 0 and 14.

Methods: From January 30, 2020 to March 23, 2020, we conducted a non-randomised controlled trial, in which all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were assigned to three groups non-randomly and given supportive treatments: Group A, Lopinavir-Ritonavir; Group B, Huashi Baidu Formula (a Chinese medicineformula made by the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences to treat COVID-19, which is now in the clinical trial period) and Lopinavir-Ritonavir; and Group C, Huashi Baidu Formula. The use of antibiotics, antiviruses, and corticosteroids was permitted in Group A and B. Traditional Chinese medicine injections were permitted in Group C. The primary outcomes were clinical remission time (interval from admission to the first time the patient tested negatively for novel coronavirus or an obvious improvement was observed from chest CT) and clinical remission rate (number of patients whose clinical time was within 16 days/total number of patients). Results: A total of 60 adult patients with COVID-19 were enrolled at sites in Wuhan, China, and the sample size of each group was 20. In Groups A, B and C, the clinical remission rates were 95.0%%(19/20), 100.0%%(20/20) and 100.0%%(20/20), respectively. Compared with Groups A and B, the clinical remission time of Group C was significantly shorter (5.9 days vs. 10.8 days, p < 0.05; 5.9 days vs. 9.7 days, p < 0.05). There was no significant difference among Groups A, B, and C in terms of the time taken to be released from quarantine. The clinical biochemical indicators and safety indexes showed no significant differences among the three groups. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that Lopinavir-Ritonavir has some efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19, and the Huashi Baidu Formula might enhance this effect to an extent. In addition, superiority was displayed in the treatment of COVID-19 through a combination of the Huashi Baidu Formula and traditional Chinese medicine injection. In future, well-designed prospective double-blinded randomised control trials are required to confirm our findings.","[Hu, Lijie; Shi, Huaxin; Huang, Luqi] China Acad Chinese Med Sci, Beijing 100700, Peoples R China; [Shi, Nannan; Liu, Bin; Chen, Renbo; Li, Li; Liu, Jia; Lu, Cheng; Shi, Zhan; Tian, Yaxin; Xiong, Yibai] China Acad Chinese Med Sci, Inst Basic Res Clin Med, Beijing 100700, Peoples R China; [Guo, Lanping] China Acad Chinese Med Sci, Natl Resource Ctr Chinese Mat Medial, Beijing 100700, Peoples R China; [Bian, Yongjun; Chen, Suping; Chen, Yang; Guo, Jing; Leng, Luxing; Li, Dongxu; Lv, Wenliang; Qi, Wensheng; Shi, Jiaheng; Wang, Jian; Wang, Wei; Yan, Bei; Yang, Jinliang] China Acad Chinese Med Sci, Guanganmen Hosp, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yingying; Cong, Xiaodong; Dong, Guoju; Jiang, Jianxin; Li, Bin; Li, Hao; Li, Jing; Miao, Qing; Wang, Bing; Wang, Gang; Xian, Yongyue; Xie, Xiaolei; Xu, Chunyan; Xu, Ming; Zhang, Li; Zhou, Zhenqi; Zhu, Haoning] China Acad Chinese Med Sci, Xiyuan Hosp, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China","Huang, LQ (corresponding author), China Acad Chinese Med Sci, Beijing 100700, Peoples R China.",Huangluqi01@126.com,,"Liu, Bin/0000-0003-1162-5930","Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, China [2019YFC1712000, 2018ZX10101001-005-003, 2018ZX10101001-005004, 2020YFC0841500]","The authors thank the participants and staff of the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences and its affiliated department for their valuable contributions.

As these drugs are being used in varied regimens and dosages, it is important to enable synthesis of existing safety data from clinical trials. However, availability of safety information is limited by a lack of timely reporting of overall clinical trial results on public registries or through academic publication. We aimed to analyse the evidence gap in this data by conducting a rapid review of results posting on and in academic publications to quantify the number of trials missing results for drugs potentially being repurposed for COVID-19. Methods: was searched for 19 drugs that have been identified as potential treatments for COVID-19. Relevant clinical trials for any prior indication were listed by identifier (NCT number) and checked for results and for timely result reporting (within 395 days of the primary completion date). Additionally, PubMed and Google Scholar were searched to identify publications of results not listed on the registry. A second, blinded search of 10% of trials was conducted to assess reviewer concordance. Results: Of 3754 completed trials, 1516 (40.4%) did not post results on or in the academic literature. Tabular results were available on for 1172 (31.2%) completed trials. A further 1066 (28.4%) had published results in the academic literature, but did not report results on . Key drugs missing clinical trial results include hydroxychloroquine (37.0% completed trials unreported), favipiravir (77.8%) and lopinavir (40.5%). Conclusions: There is an important evidence gap for the safety of drugs being repurposed for COVID-19. This uncertainty could cause unnecessary additional morbidity and mortality during the pandemic. We recommend caution in experimental drug use for non-severe disease and urge clinical trial sponsors to report missing results retrospectively.","[Rodgers, Florence; Pepperrell, Toby] Imperial Coll London, Sch Med, London, England; [Keestra, Sarai] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Keestra, Sarai] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, London, England; [Pilkington, Victoria] Univ Oxford, Clin Acad Grad Sch, Oxford, England","Rodgers, F (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Sch Med, London, England.",florence.rodgers15@imperial.ac.uk,,"Rodgers, Florence/0000-0001-6627-1143",,,,37,0,0,24,24,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1745-6215,,TRIALS,Trials,JAN 15,2021,22,1,,,,,,,59,10.1186/s13063-021-05024-y,,,10,"Medicine, Research & Experimental",Research & Experimental Medicine,PS6RA,WOS:000608052500001,33451350,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2021-03-31,

Neutralizing antibodies are a potential treatment for COVID-19. OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of bamlanivimab monotherapy and combination therapy with bamlanivimab and etesevimab on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load in mild to moderate COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The BLAZE-1 study is a randomized phase 2/3 trial at 49 US centers including ambulatory patients (N = 613) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and had 1 or more mild to moderate symptoms. Patients who received bamlanivimab monotherapy or placebo were enrolled first (June 17-August 21, 2020) followed by patients who received bamlanivimab and etesevimab or placebo (August 22-September 3). These are the final analyses and represent findings through October 6, 2020. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to receive a single infusion of bamlanivimab (700 mg [n = 101], 2800 mg [n = 107], or 7000 mg [n = 101]), the combination treatment (2800 mg of bamlanivimab and 2800 mg of etesevimab [n = 112]), or placebo (n = 156). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was change in SARS-CoV-2 log viral load at day 11 (+/- 4 days). Nine prespecified secondary outcome measures were evaluated with comparisons between each treatment group and placebo, and included 3 other measures of viral load, 5 on symptoms, and 1 measure of clinical outcome (the proportion of patients with a COVID-19-related hospitalization, an emergency department [ED] visit, or death at day 29). RESULTS Among the 577 patients who were randomized and received an infusion (mean age, 44.7 [SD, 15.7] years; 315 [54.6%] women), 533 (92.4%) completed the efficacy evaluation period (day 29). The change in log viral load from baseline at day 11 was -3.72 for 700 mg, -4.08 for 2800 mg, -3.49 for 7000 mg, -4.37 for combination treatment, and -3.80 for placebo. Compared with placebo, the differences in the change in log viral load at day 11 were 0.09 (95% CI, -0.35 to 0.52; P = .69) for 700 mg, -0.27 (95% CI, -0.71 to 0.16; P = .21) for 2800 mg, 0.31 (95% CI, -0.13 to 0.76; P = .16) for 7000 mg, and -0.57 (95% CI, -1.00 to -0.14; P = .01) for combination treatment. Among the secondary outcome measures, differences between each treatment group vs the placebo group were statistically significant for 10 of 84 end points. The proportion of patients with COVID-19-related hospitalizations or ED visits was 5.8% (9 events) for placebo, 1.0% (1 event) for 700 mg, 1.9% (2 events) for 2800 mg, 2.0% (2 events) for 7000 mg, and 0.9% (1 event) for combination treatment. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 9 patients (6 bamlanivimab, 2 combination treatment, and 1 placebo). No deaths occurred during the study treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among nonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness, treatment with bamlanivimab and etesevimab, compared with placebo, was associated with a statistically significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load at day 11; no significant difference in viral load reduction was observed for bamlanivimab monotherapy. Further ongoing clinical trials will focus on assessing the clinical benefit of antispike neutralizing antibodies in patients with COVID-19 as a primary end point.","[Nirula, Ajay; Adams, Andrew C.; Van Naarden, Jacob; Custer, Kenneth L.; Durante, Michael; Oakley, Gerard; Schade, Andrew E.; Holzer, Timothy R.; Ebert, Philip J.; Higgs, Richard E.; Kallewaard, Nicole L.; Sabo, Janelle; Patel, Dipak R.; Klekotka, Paul; Shen, Lei; Skovronsky, Daniel M.] Eli Lilly & Co, 893 Delaware St, Indianapolis, IN 46225 USA; [Gottlieb, Robert L.] Baylor Univ, Med Ctr, Dallas, TX USA; [Gottlieb, Robert L.] Baylor Scott & White Res Inst, Dallas, TX USA; [Chen, Peter] Cedars Sinai Med Ctr, Dept Med, Womens Guild Lung Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90048 USA; [Boscia, Joseph] Vitalink Res, Union, SC USA; [Heller, Barry] Long Beach Clin Trials, Long Beach, CA USA; [Morris, Jason] Imperial Hlth, Lake Charles, LA USA; [Huhn, Gregory] Cook Cty Hlth, Chicago, IL USA; [Cardona, Jose] Indago Res, Hialeah, FL USA; [Mocherla, Bharat] Las Vegas Med Res Ctr, Las Vegas, NV USA; [Stosor, Valentina] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Shawa, Imad] Franciscan Hlth, Greenwood, IN USA; [Kumar, Princy] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC USA","Skovronsky, DM (corresponding author), Eli Lilly & Co, 893 Delaware St, Indianapolis, IN 46225 USA.",skovronsky_daniel@lilly.com,"Chen, Peter/AAH-9639-2021","Gottlieb, Robert/0000-0001-8376-8709",Eli Lilly and CompanyEli Lilly,This trial was sponsored and funded by Eli Lilly and Company.,,20,2,2,5,5,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

In addressing mental health needs, web-based interventions have shown increasing promise in overcoming geographic distances and high student-to-counselor ratios, leading to the potential for wider implementation. The Mindfulness Virtual Community (MVC) program, a web-based program, guided by mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy principles, is among efforts aimed at effectively and efficiently reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and perceived stress in students. Objective: This study's aim was to evaluate the efficacy of an 8-week MVC program in reducing depression, anxiety, and perceived stress (primary outcomes), and improving mindfulness (secondary outcome) in undergraduate students at a large Canadian university. Guided by two prior randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that each demonstrated efficacy when conducted during regular university operations, this study coincided with a university-wide labor strike. Nonetheless, the students' response to an online mental health program on a disrupted campus can provide useful information for anticipating the impact of other disruptions, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future disruptions. Methods: In this parallel-arm RCT, 154 students were randomly allocated to an 8-week MVC intervention (n=76) or a wait-list control (WLC) condition (n=78). The MVC intervention included the following: (1) educational and mindfulness video modules, (2) anonymous peer-to-peer discussions, and (3) anonymous, group-based, professionally guided, 20-minute videoconferences. Study outcomes were evaluated at baseline and at 8-week follow-up using the following: Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAT), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire Short Form (FFMQ-SF). Generalized estimation equations with an AR (1) covariance structure were used to evaluate the impact of the intervention, with outcome evaluations performed on both an intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) basis. Results: Participants (n=154) included 35 males and 117 females with a mean age of 23.1 years. There were no statistically significant differences at baseline between the MVC and WLC groups on demographics and psychological characteristics, indicating similar demographic and psychological characteristics across the two groups. Results under both ITT and PP approaches indicated that there were no statistically significant between-group differences in PHQ-9 (ITT: beta=-0.44, P=.64; PP: beta=-0.62, P=.053), BAI (ITT: beta=-2.06, P=.31; PP: beta=-2.32, P=.27), and FFMQ-SF (ITT: beta=1.33, P=.43; PP: beta=1.44, P=.41) compared to WLC. There was a significant difference for the PSS (ITT: beta=-2.31, P=.03; PP: beta=-2.38, P=.03). Conclusions: During a university labor strike, the MVC program led to statistically significant reductions in PSS compared to the WLC group, but there were no other significant between-group differences. Comparisons with previous cycles of intervention testing, undertaken during nondisrupted university operations, when efficacy was demonstrated, are discussed.","[Ritvo, Paul; Pirbaglou, Meysam] York Univ, Fac Hlth, Sch Kinesiol & Hlth Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Ahmad, Farah; El Morr, Christo] York Univ, Sch Hlth Policy & Management, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Moineddin, Rahim] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [MVC Team] York Univ, Toronto, ON, Canada","El Morr, C (corresponding author), York Univ, Sch Hlth Policy & Management, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",elmorr@yorku.ca,"Morr, Christo El/F-7534-2014","Morr, Christo El/0000-0001-6287-3438; Moineddin, Rahim/0000-0002-5506-084X; Ahmad, Farah/0000-0001-9747-1148; Ritvo, Paul/0000-0003-1141-0083",Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) eHealth Innovations Partnership Program Grant (eHIPP)Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [EH1-143553],"The authors acknowledge the contribution of all students who gave their valuable time to participate in the study.

Here, we tested whether high-dose vitamin C infusion was effective for severe COVID-19. Methods: This randomized, controlled, clinical trial was performed at 3 hospitals in Hubei, China. Patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the ICU were randomly assigned in as 1:1 ratio to either the high-dose intravenous vitamin C (HDIVC) or the placebo. HDIVC group received 12 g of vitamin C/50 ml every 12 h for 7 days at a rate of 12 ml/hour, and the placebo group received bacteriostatic water for injection in the same way within 48 h of arrival to ICU. The primary outcome was invasive mechanical ventilation-free days in 28 days (IMVFD28). Secondary outcomes were 28-day mortality, organ failure (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score), and inflammation progression (interleukin-6). Results: Only 56 critical COVID-19 patients were ultimately recruited due to the early control of the outbreak. There was no difference in IMVFD28 between two groups (26.0 [9.0-28.0] in HDIVC vs 22.0 [8.50-28.0] in control, p = 0.57). HDIVC failed to reduce 28-day mortality (P = 0.27). During the 7-day treatment period, patients in the HDIVC group had a steady rise in the PaO2/FiO(2) (day 7: 229 vs. 151 mmHg, 95% CI 33 to 122, P = 0.01), which was not observed in the control group. IL-6 in the HDIVC group was lower than that in the control group (19.42 vs. 158.00; 95% CI -301.72 to -29.79; P = 0.04) on day 7. Conclusion: This pilot trial showed that HDIVC failed to improve IMVFD28, but might show a potential signal of benefit in oxygenation for critically ill patients with COVID-19 improving PaO2/FiO2 even though.","[Zhang, Jing; Rao, Xin; Li, Yiming; Zhu, Yuan; Liu, Fang; Xiang, Hui; Peng, Zhiyong] Wuhan Univ, Zhongnan Hosp, Dept Crit Care Med, Wuhan 430071, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Guo, Guangling] Huibei Univ Med, Antiaging Med Ctr, Taihe Hosp, Shiyan 442000, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Luo, Guoshi] Huibei Univ Med, Taihe Hosp, Dept Pulm & Crit Care Med, Shiyan 442000, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Meng, Zhongji] Huibei Univ Med, Taihe Hosp, Dept Infect Dis, Shiyan 442000, Hubei, Peoples R China; [De Backer, Daniel] Univ Libre Bruxelles, CHIREC Hosp, Dept Intens Care, Brussels, Belgium; [Xiang, Hui; Peng, Zhiyong] Clin Res Ctr Hubei Crit Care Med, Wuhan 430071, Hubei, Peoples R China","Xiang, H; Peng, ZY (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Zhongnan Hosp, Dept Crit Care Med, Wuhan 430071, Hubei, Peoples R China.",xianghuisky@163.com; Pengzy5@hotmail.com,,,"Science and Technology Department of Hubei Province [2020FCA024, 2020FCA020]; Special Project for Significant New Drug Research and Development in the Major National Science and Technology Projects of China [2020ZX09201007]","This work was funded by the Science and Technology Department of Hubei Province (2020FCA024, 2020FCA020), and the Special Project for Significant New Drug Research and Development in the Major National Science and Technology Projects of China (2020ZX09201007).",,41,2,2,11,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2110-5820,,,ANN INTENSIVE CARE,Ann.

Methods: A randomized, open-label controlled trial of oral favipiravir in adults hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia from June 22nd 2020 to August 13th 2020 was conducted. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a combination of favipiravir with interferon beta-1b by inhalation aerosol or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The outcome endpoints included improvement in inflammatory markers, lower length of hospital stay (LOS), discharges and lower overall 14-day mortality. Results: A total of 89 patients underwent randomization with 49% (n = 44) assigned to favipiravir and 51% (n = 45) assigned HCQ. The overall mean age was 55 14 years and 58% (n = 52) were males. There were no significant differences in the inflammatory biomarkers at hospital discharge between the two groups; C-reactive protein (p = 0.413), ferritin (p = 0.968), lactate dehydrogenase (p = 0.259) and interleukin 6 (p = 0.410). There were also no significant differences between the two groups with regards to the overall LOS (7 vs 7 days; p = 0.948), transfers to the ICU (18.2% vs 17.8%; p = 0.960), discharges (65.9% vs 68.9%; p = 0.764) and overall mortality (11.4% vs 13.3%; p = 0.778).

Further, rigorous assessment of interventions prior to widespread dissemination is crucial. Objective: This study assesses the effectiveness and implementation fidelity of the ACT Out! Social Issue Theater program, a 1-hour psychodramatic intervention by professional actors; it also measures students' receptiveness to the intervention. Methods: This study is a 2-arm cluster randomized control trial with 1:1 allocation that randomized either to the ACT Out! intervention or control (treatment as usual) at the classroom level (n=76 classrooms in 12 schools across 5 counties in Indiana, comprised of 1571 students at pretest in fourth, seventh, and tenth grades). The primary outcomes were self-reported social-emotional competence, bullying perpetration, and bullying victimization; the secondary outcomes were receptiveness to the intervention, implementation fidelity (independent observer observation), and prespecified subanalyses of social-emotional competence for seventh- and tenth-grade students. All outcomes were collected at baseline and 2-week posttest, with planned 3-months posttest data collection prevented due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Intervention fidelity was uniformly excellent (>96% adherence), and students were highly receptive to the program. However, trial results did not support the hypothesis that the intervention would increase participants' social-emotional competence. The intervention's impact on bullying was complicated to interpret and included some evidence of small interaction effects (reduced cyberbullying victimization and increased physical bullying perpetration). Additionally, pooled within-group reductions were also observed and discussed but were not appropriate for causal attribution. Conclusions: This study found no superiority for a 1-hour ACT Out! intervention compared to treatment as usual for social-emotional competence or offline bullying, but some evidence of a small effect for cyberbullying. On the basis of these results and the within-group effects, as a next step, we encourage research into whether the ACT Out! intervention may engender a bystander effect not amenable to randomization by classroom. Therefore, we recommend a larger trial of the ACT Out! intervention that focuses specifically on cyberbullying, measures bystander behavior, is randomized by school, and is controlled for extant bullying prevention efforts at each school.","[Agley, Jon; Jun, Mikyoung; Eldridge, Lori; Agley, Daniel L.; Jayawardene, Wasantha; Gassman, Ruth] Indiana Univ Bloomington, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Appl Hlth Sci, Prevent Insights, 501 N Morton St Suite 110, Bloomington, IN 47404 USA; [Xiao, Yunyu] Indiana Univ Bloomington & Indiana Univ, Sch Social Work, Indianapolis, IN USA; [Xiao, Yunyu] Purdue Univ Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN USA; [Sussman, Steve] Univ Southern Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Prevent Med, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Sussman, Steve] Univ Southern Calif, Dana & David Dornsife Coll Letters Arts & Sci, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Sussman, Steve] Univ Southern Calif, Sch Social Work, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Golzarri-Arroyo, Lilian; Dickinson, Stephanie L.] Indiana Univ Bloomington, Biostat Consulting Ctr, Sch Publ Hlth Bloomington, Bloomington, IN USA","Agley, J (corresponding author), Indiana Univ Bloomington, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Appl Hlth Sci, Prevent Insights, 501 N Morton St Suite 110, Bloomington, IN 47404 USA.",jagley@indiana.edu,"Agley, Jon/AAA-6758-2021","Eldridge, Lori Ann/0000-0002-7542-1091; Sussman, Steve/0000-0002-6778-9718; Jayawardene, Wasantha/0000-0002-8798-0894; Golzarri-Arroyo, Lilian/0000-0002-1221-6701; Gassman, Ruth/0000-0003-2781-7320; Agley, Daniel/0000-0002-0377-8729; Dickinson, Stephanie/0000-0002-2998-4467",Lilly Endowment Inc [2019 0543],"Funding for this study was provided by Lilly Endowment Inc, grant no. 2019 0543, to Claude McNeal Productions.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the outcomes of all-cause 30-day hospital encounter proportion among patients who have a postdischarge video-based virtual visit follow-up compared with in-person follow-up. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, active, controlled noninferiority trial in an urban setting, including patients from a small community hospital and a large, tertiary care hospital. Patients who underwent minimally invasive appendectomy or cholecystectomy by a group of surgeons who cover emergency general surgery at these 2 hospitals were included. Patients undergoing elective and nonelective procedures were included. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to video-based virtual visit or in-person visit. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome is the percentage of patients with 30-day hospital encounter, and we hypothesized that there would not be a significant increase in the 30-day hospital encounter proportion for patients who receive video-based virtual postdischarge care compared with patients who receive standard (in-person) care. Hospital encounter includes emergency department visit, observation, or inpatient admission. RESULTS A total of 1645 patients were screened; 289 patients were randomized to the virtual group and 143 to the in-person group. Fifty-three patients crossed over to the in-person follow-up group. The percentage of patients who had a hospital encounter was noninferior for virtual visits (12.8% vs 13.3% for in-person, Delta 0.5% with 1-sided 95% CI, -infinity to 5.2%). The amount of time patients spent with the clinician (mean of 8.4 minutes virtual vs 7.8 minutes in-person; P = .30) was not different, but the median overall postoperative visit time was 27.5 minutes shorter (95% CI, -33.5 to -24.0). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Postdischarge video-based virtual visits did not increase hospital encounter proportions and provided shorter overall time commitment but equal time with the surgical team member. This information will help surgeons and patients feel more confident in using video-based virtual visits.","[Harkey, Kristen; Kaiser, Nicole; Matthews, Brent D.; Reinke, Caroline E.] Carolinas Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Charlotte, NC USA; [Zhao, Jing; Hetherington, Timothy; Gutnik, Bella] Atrium Hlth, Ctr Outcomes Res & Evaluat, Charlotte, NC USA; [Kelz, Rachel R.] Univ Penn Hlth Syst, Hosp Univ Penn, Dept Surg, Philadelphia, PA USA","Reinke, CE (corresponding author), Carolinas Med Ctr, 1025 Morehead Med Plaza,Ste 300, Charlotte, NC 28204 USA.",caroline.e.reinke@atriumhealth.org,,,American College of Surgeons Franklin H.

This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes and plasma concentrations of baloxavir acid and favipiravir in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Favipiravir and baloxavir acid were evaluated for their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro before the trial initiation. We conducted an exploratory trial with 3 arms involving hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19. Patients were randomized assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio into baloxavir marboxil group, favipiravir group, and control group. The primary outcome was the percentage of subjects with viral negative by Day 14 and the time from randomization to clinical improvement. Virus load reduction, blood drug concentration and clinical presentation were also observed. The trial was registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR 2000029544). Results: Baloxavir acid showed antiviral activity in vitro with the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 5.48 mu M comparable to arbidol and lopinavir, but favipiravir didn't demonstrate significant antiviral activity up to 100 mu M. Thirty patients were enrolled. The percentage of patients who turned viral negative after 14-day treatment was 70%, 77%, and 100% in the baloxavir marboxil, favipiravir, and control group respectively, with the medians of time from randomization to clinical improvement was 14, 14 and 15 days, respectively. One reason for the lack of virological effect and clinical benefits may be due to insufficient concentrations of these drugs relative to their antiviral activities. One of the limitations of this study is the time from symptom onset to randomization, especially in the baloxavir marboxil and control groups, which is higher than the favipiravir group. Conclusions: Our findings could not prove a benefit of addition of either baloxavir marboxil or favipiravir under the trial dosages to the existing standard treatment.","[Lou, Yan; Liu, Lin; Yao, Hangping; Hu, Xingjiang; Su, Junwei; Xu, Kaijin; Luo, Rui; Yang, Xi; He, Lingjuan; Lu, Xiaoyang; Zhao, Qingwei; Liang, Tingbo; Qiu, Yunqing] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Med,Affiliated Hosp 1, State Key Lab Diag & Treatment Infect Dis, Key Lab Drug Evaluat & Clin Res Zhejiang Prov, 79 Qingchun Rd, Hangzhou 310003, Peoples R China","Qiu, YQ (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Sch Med,Affiliated Hosp 1, State Key Lab Diag & Treatment Infect Dis, Key Lab Drug Evaluat & Clin Res Zhejiang Prov, 79 Qingchun Rd, Hangzhou 310003, Peoples R China.",qiuyq@zju.edu.cn,,,Zhejiang Provincial Science and technology department key RAMP;D plan emergency project [2020c03123-8],"This article was supported by Zhejiang Provincial Science and technology department key R&D plan emergency project (No. 2020c03123-8).

Several vaccine trial designs may significantly accelerate vaccine testing and approval, but also increase risks to human subjects. Concerns about whether the public would see such designs as ethical represent an important roadblock to their implementation; accordingly, both the World Health Organization and numerous scholars have called for consulting the public regarding them. We answered these calls by conducting a cross-national survey (n = 5920) in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand, South Africa, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The survey explained key differences between traditional vaccine trials and two accelerated designs: a challenge trial or a trial integrating a Phase II safety and immunogenicity trial into a larger Phase III efficacy trial. Respondents' answers to comprehension questions indicate that they largely understood the key differences and ethical trade-offs between the designs from our descriptions. We asked respondents whether they would prefer scientists to conduct traditional trials or one of these two accelerated designs. We found broad majorities prefer for scientists to conduct challenge trials (75%) and integrated trials (63%) over standard trials. Even as respondents acknowledged the risks, they perceived both accelerated trials as similarly ethical to standard trial designs. This high support is consistent across every geography and demographic subgroup we examined, including vulnerable populations. These findings may help assuage some of the concerns surrounding accelerated designs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Use of Mobile health for vaccine safety surveillance enables a consumer-centred approach to reporting. The Stimulated Telephone Assisted Rapid Safety Surveillance (STARSS) a randomised control trial (RCT) sought to evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of SMS for AEFI surveillance. Methods: Multi-centre RCT, participants were adult vaccinees or parents of children receiving any vaccine at a trial site. At enrolment randomisation occurred to one of two SMS groups or a control group. Prompts on days 2, 7 and 14 post-immunisation, were sent to the SMS group, to ascertain if a medical event following immunisation (MEFI) had occurred. No SMS's were sent to the control participants. Those in the SMS who notified an MEFI were pre-randomised to complete a computer assisted telephone interview or a web based report to determine if an AEFI had occurred whilst an AEFI in the controls was determined by a search for passive reports. The primary outcome was the AEFI detection rate in the SMS group compared to controls. Results: We enrolled 6,338 participants, who were equally distributed across groups and who received 11,675 vaccines. The SMS group (4,225) received 12,675 surveillance prompts with 9.8% being noncompliant and not responding. In those that responded 90% indicated that no MEFI had been experienced and 184 had a verified AEFI. 6 control subjects had a reported AEFI. The AEFI detection rate was 13 fold greater in the SMS group when compared with controls (4.3 vs 0.3%). Conclusion: We have demonstrated that the STARSS methodology improves AEFI detection. Our findings should inform the wider use of SMS-based surveillance which is particularly relevant since establishing robust and novel pharmacovigilance systems is critical to monitoring novel vaccines which includes potential COVID vaccines.

Mesenchymal stem cells are known to exert immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects and could yield beneficial effects in COVID-19 ARDS. The objective of this study was to determine safety and explore efficacy of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (UC-MSC) infusions in subjects with COVID-19 ARDS. A double-blind, phase 1/2a, randomized, controlled trial was performed. Randomization and stratification by ARDS severity was used to foster balance among groups. All subjects were analyzed under intention to treat design. Twenty-four subjects were randomized 1:1 to either UC-MSC treatment (n = 12) or the control group (n = 12). Subjects in the UC-MSC treatment group received two intravenous infusions (at day 0 and 3) of 100 +/- 20 x 10(6) UC-MSCs; controls received two infusions of vehicle solution. Both groups received best standard of care. Primary endpoint was safety (adverse events [AEs]) within 6 hours; cardiac arrest or death within 24 hours postinfusion). Secondary endpoints included patient survival at 31 days after the first infusion and time to recovery. No difference was observed between groups in infusion-associated AEs. No serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed related to UC-MSC infusions. UC-MSC infusions in COVID-19 ARDS were found to be safe. Inflammatory cytokines were significantly decreased in UC-MSC-treated subjects at day 6. Treatment was associated with significantly improved patient survival (91% vs 42%, P = .015), SAE-free survival (P = .008), and time to recovery (P = .03). UC-MSC infusions are safe and could be beneficial in treating subjects with COVID-19 ARDS.","[Lanzoni, Giacomo; Linetsky, Elina; Correa, Diego; Kouroupis, Dimitrios; Gil, Ana Alvarez; Poggioli, Raffaella; Hirani, Khemraj; Rafkin, Lisa; Baidal, David; Lenero, Clarissa; Wang, Xiaojing; Roque, Luis; Masters, Burlett; Kenyon, Norma S.; Xu, Xiumin; Alejandro, Rodolfo; Ricordi, Camillo] Univ Miami, Cell Transplant Ctr, Diabet Res Inst, Miller Sch Med, 1450 NW 10th Ave, Miami, FL 33137 USA; [Lanzoni, Giacomo] Univ Miami, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Miller Sch Med, Miami, FL 33137 USA; [Linetsky, Elina; Ruiz, Phillip; Ginzburg, Enrique; Ricordi, Camillo] Univ Miami, Dept Surg, Miller Sch Med, Miami, FL 33137 USA; [Correa, Diego] Univ Miami, UHlth Sports Med Inst, Dept Orthoped, Miller Sch Med, Miami, FL 33137 USA; [Cayetano, Shari Messinger; Mantero, Alejandro M.

In theory, tocilizumab and favipiravir are considered to be reliable drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 with elevated IL-6. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab combined with favipiravir in patients with COVID-19. Methods: This was a multicenter trial in adults with COVID-19. Patients were randomly assigned (3:1:1) to a 14 day combination of favipiravir combined with tocilizumab (combination group), favipiravir, and tocilizumab. The primary outcome was the cumulative lung lesion remission rate (lung CT examination indicated absorption of lung inflammation). Results: Between Feb 2 and March 15, 2020, 26 patients were recruited; 14 were randomly assigned to the combination group, 7 were assigned to the favipiravir group and 5 were assigned to the tocilizumab group. The cumulative lung lesion remission rate at day 14 was significantly higher in combination group as compared with favipiravir group (P = 0.019, HR 2.66 95 % CI [1.08-6.53]). And there was also a significant difference between tocilizumab and favipivavir (P = 0.034, HR 3.16, 95 % CI 0.62-16.10). In addition, there was no significant difference between the combination group and the tocilizumab group (P = 0.575, HR 1.28 95 %CI 0.39-4.23). Furthermore, combined therapy can also significantly relieve clinical symptoms and help blood routine to return to normal. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Tocilizumab combined with or without favipiravir can effectively improve the pulmonary inflammation of COVID-19 patients and inhibit the deterioration of the disease.","[Zhao, Hong; Zhang, Chi; Li, Jiawen; Wu, Zhao; Wang, Guiqiang] Peking Univ First Hosp, Dept Infect Dis, Ctr Liver Dis, 8 Xishiku St, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Hong; Wang, Guiqiang] Peking Univ Int Hosp, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Qi; Chen, Guilin] Wuhan Pulm Hosp, Dept TB, Wuhan 430030, Peoples R China; [Wei, Ming; Wang, Ke] Wuhan Jinyintan Hosp, 1 Yintan Rd, Wuhan 430040, Peoples R China; [Qin, Yuhong] Peking Univ Int Hosp, Emergency Dept, Life Sci Pk, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Yu, Junhua] Ezhou Cent Hosp, 9 Wenxing Rd, Ezhou City 463000, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xianxiang] Wuhan Pulm Hosp, Dept Surg, 28 Baofeng Rd, Wuhan 430030, Peoples R China","Chen, XX (corresponding author), Wuhan Pulm Hosp, Dept Surg, 28 Baofeng Rd, Wuhan 430030, Peoples R China.; Wang, GQ (corresponding author), Peking Univ First Hosp, Dept Infect Dis, 8 Xishiku St, Beijing 100034, Peoples R China.; Wang, GQ (corresponding author), Peking Univ First Hosp, Ctr Liver Dis, 8 Xishiku St, Beijing 100034, Peoples R China.",2272534937@qq.com; john131212@126.com,,,"Chinese COVID-19 scientific research emergency project [2020YFC0844100, 2020YFC0846800]; China Mega-Project for Infectious Diseases [2017ZX10203202, 2013ZX10002005]; China Mega-Project for Innovative Drugs [2016ZX09101065]","This study was supported by Chinese COVID-19 scientific research emergency project (grant numbers 2020YFC0844100, 2020YFC0846800), China Mega-Project for Infectious Diseases (grant numbers 2017ZX10203202, 2013ZX10002005) and China Mega-Project for Innovative Drugs (grant numbers 2016ZX09101065).",,27,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER FRANCE-EDITIONS SCIENTIFIQUES MEDICALES ELSEVIER,ISSY-LES-MOULINEAUX,"65 RUE CAMILLE DESMOULINS, CS50083, 92442 ISSY-LES-MOULINEAUX, FRANCE",0753-3322,1950-6007,,BIOMED PHARMACOTHER,Biomed.

Because large randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and a well-conducted meta-analysis on the use of corticosteroids, focused on patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in intensive care units, recently were published, a meta-analysis of RCTs on corticosteroids therapy in patients with different disease severity was performed to evaluate the effect on survival. Design: A meta-analyses of RCTs was performed. Setting: Patients admitted to hospital. Participants: Patients with coronavirus disease. Interventions: Administration of corticosteroids. Measurements and Main Results: A search was performed for RCTs of adult patients with acute hypoxemic failure related to 2019-nCoV infection who received corticosteroids versus any comparator. The primary endpoint was mortality rate. Five RCTs involving 7,692 patients were included. Overall mortality of patients treated with corticosteroids was slightly but significantly lower than mortality of controls (26% v 28%, relative risk {RR} = 0.89 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.82-0.96], p = 0.003). The same beneficial effect was found in the subgroup of patients requiring mechanical ventilation (RR = 0.85 [95% CI 0.72-1.00], p = 0.05 number needed to treat {NNT} = 19). Remarkably, corticosteroids increased mortality in the subgroup of patients not requiring oxygen (17% v 13%, RR = 1.23 [95% CI 1.00-1.62], p = 0.05 number needed to harm {NNH} = 29). Tests for comparison between mechanically ventilated subgroups and those not requiring oxygen confirmed that treatment with corticosteroids had a statistically significant different effect on survival. Patients treated with corticosteroids had a significantly lower risk of need for mechanical ventilation. Conclusions: Corticosteroids may be considered in severe critically ill patients with COVID-19 but must be discouraged in patients not requiring oxygen therapy. Urgently, further trials are warranted before implementing this treatment worldwide. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

To provide sufficient information for all involveddecision-makers (clinicians, public health authorities, and drug regulatory agencies), a multiplicity of endpoints must be considered. The objectives are to provide hands-on statistical guidelines for harmonizing heterogeneous endpoints in coronavirus disease 2019 clinical trials. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trials for patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019. SETTING: General methods that apply to any randomized controlled trial for patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019. PATIENTS: Coronavirus disease 2019 positive individuals. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We develop a multistate model that is based on hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, death, and discharge. These events are both categories of the ordinal endpoint recommended by the World Health Organization and also within the core outcome set of the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials initiative for coronavirus disease 2019 trials. To support our choice of states in the multistate model, we also perform a brief review of registered coronavirus disease 2019 clinical trials. Based on the multistate model, we give recommendation for compact, informative illustration of time-dynamic treatment effects and explorative statistical analysis. A majority of coronavirus disease 2019 clinical trials collect information on mechanical ventilation, hospitalization, and death. Using reconstructed and real data of coronavirus disease 2019 trials, we show how a stacked probability plot provides a detailed understanding of treatment effects on the patients' course of hospital stay. It contributes to harmonizing multiple endpoints and differing lengths of follow-up both within and between trials. CONCLUSIONS: All ongoing clinical trials should include a stacked probability plot in their statistical analysis plan as descriptive analysis. While primary analysis should be on an early endpoint with appropriate capability to be a surrogate (parameter), our multistate model provides additional detailed descriptive information and links results within and between coronavirus disease 2019 trials.","[von Cube, Maja; Grodd, Marlon; Wolkewitz, Martin; Hazard, Derek; Lambert, Jerome] Univ Freiburg, Inst Med Biometry & Stat, Fac Med, Freiburg, Germany; [von Cube, Maja; Grodd, Marlon; Wolkewitz, Martin; Hazard, Derek; Lambert, Jerome] Univ Freiburg, Med Ctr, Freiburg, Germany; [von Cube, Maja; Grodd, Marlon; Wolkewitz, Martin; Hazard, Derek] Univ Freiburg, Freiburg Ctr Data Anal & Modeling, Freiburg, Germany; [Wengenmayer, Tobias] Univ Freiburg, Dept Med Interdisciplinary Med Intens Care 3, Fac Med, Med Ctr, Freiburg, Germany; [Canet, Emmanuel] Univ Nantes, Nantes Univ Hosp, Med Intens Care Unit, Nantes, France; [Lambert, Jerome] CRESS, Epidemiol & Clin Stat Tumor Resp & Resuscitat Ass, INSERM, U1153, Paris, France","von Cube, M (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Inst Med Biometry & Stat, Fac Med, Freiburg, Germany.; von Cube, M (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Med Ctr, Freiburg, Germany.",cube@imbi.uni-freiburg.de,,,Education and Qualification for Postdocs Medical Scientist Program of the University of Freiburg; Edmond de Rothschild Foundation Medical Fellowship Program,Dr. von Cube has been supported by the Education and Qualification for Postdocs Medical Scientist Program of the University of Freiburg.

The purpose of the present review was to evaluate the potential mechanisms that contribute to this increased risk of coagulopathy and the role of anticoagulants in treatment. Methods: A literature review of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and/or SARS-CoV-2 and cell-mediated inflammation, clinical coagulation abnormalities, hypercoagulability, pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy, and anticoagulation was performed. The National Clinical Trials database was queried for ongoing studies of anticoagulation and/or antithrombotic treatment or the incidence or prevalence of thrombotic events in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: The reported rate of VTE among critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 has been 21% to 69%. The phenomenon of breakthrough VTE, or the acute development of VTE despite adequate chemoprophylaxis or treatment dose anticoagulation, has been shown to occur with severe infection. The pathophysiology of overt hypercoagulability and the development of VTE is likely mu ltifactorial, with evidence supporting the role of significant cell-mediated responses, including neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, endothelialitis, cytokine release syndrome, and dysregulation of fibrinolysis. Collectively, this inflammatory process contributes to the severe pulmonary pathology experienced by patients with COVID-19. As the infection worsens, extreme D-dimer elevations, significant thrombocytopenia, decreasing fibrinogen, and prolongation of prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time occur, often associated with deep vein thrombosis, in situ pulmonary thrombi, and/or pulmonary embolism. A new phenomenon, termed pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy, has been associated with morbidity in patients with severe infection. Heparin, both unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin, have emerged as agents that can address the viral infection, inflammation, and thrombosis in this syndrome. Conclusions: The overwhelming inflammatory response in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to a hypercoagulable state, microthrombosis, large vessel thrombosis, and, ultimately, death. Early VTE prophylaxis should be provided to all admitted patients. Therapeutic anticoagulation therapy might be beneficial for critically ill patients and is the focus of 39 ongoing trials. Close monitoring for thrombotic complications is imperative, and, if confirmed, early transition from prophylactic to therapeutic anticoagulation should be instituted. The interplay between inflammation and thrombosis has been shown to be a hallmark of the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection.","[Obi, Andrea T.; Henke, Peter K.; Wakefield, Thomas W.] Univ Michigan, Samuel & Jean Frankel Cardiovasc Ctr, Dept Surg, Sect Vasc Surg, 1500 E Med Ctr Dr, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Barnes, Geoffrey D.] Univ Michigan, Samuel & Jean Frankel Cardiovasc Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Div Cardiovasc Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Napolitano, Lena M.] Univ Michigan, Dept Surg, Div Crit Care Surg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Wakefield, TW (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Samuel & Jean Frankel Cardiovasc Ctr, Dept Surg, Sect Vasc Surg, 1500 E Med Ctr Dr, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",thomasww@umich.edu,,,Wylie Vascular Cures; Michigan Medicine Samuel and Jean Frankel Cardiovascular Center,The present study was supported by Wylie Vascular Cures and a COVID-19 Cardiovascular Impact Research Ignitor grant from the Michigan Medicine Samuel and Jean Frankel Cardiovascular Center (to A.O.).,,83,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-333X,,,J VASC SURG-VENOUS L,J.

Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), also known as novel coronavirus or SARSCoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2), is a respiratory based touch contiguous disease. The catastrophic situation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic posed a serious threat to societies globally. The whole world is making tremendous efforts to combat this life-threatening disease. For taking remedial action and planning preventive measures on time, there is an urgent need for efficient prediction models to confront the COVID-19 outbreak. A deep learning-based ARIMA-LSTM hybrid model is proposed in this article for predicting the COVID-19 outbreak by utilizing real-time information from the WHO's daily bulletin report as well as provides information regarding clinical trials across the world. To evaluate the suitability and performance of our proposed model compared to other well-established prediction models, an experimental study has been performed. To estimate the prediction results, the three performance measures, i.e., Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Coefficient of determination (R2 Score), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) have been employed. The prediction results of fifty countries substantiated the fact that the proposed ARIMA-LSTM hybrid model performs very well as compared to other models. The proposed model archives the lowest RMSE, lowest MAPE, and highest R2 Score throughout the testing, under varied selection criteria (country-wise). This article aims to contribute a deep learning-based solution for the wellbeing of livings and to provide the current status of clinical trials across the globe.","[Ketu, Shwet; Mishra, Pramod Kumar] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Comp Sci, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India","Ketu, S (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Comp Sci, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India.",shwetiiita@gmail.com,,,,,,48,0,0,4,4,TECH SCIENCE PRESS,HENDERSON,"871 CORONADO CENTER DR, SUTE 200, HENDERSON, NV 89052 USA",1546-2218,1546-2226,,CMC-COMPUT MATER CON,CMC-Comput.
