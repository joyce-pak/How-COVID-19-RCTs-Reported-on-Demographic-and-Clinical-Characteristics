# How COVID-19 Randomized Controlled Trials Reported on Demographic and Clinical Characteristics

We aimed to assess the reporting of key patient-level demographic and clinical characteristics among COVID-19 related RCTs. A systematic review was conducted in which we queried English-language articles from PubMed, Web of Science, clinicaltrials.gov, and the CDC library of gray literature databases using keywords of ‘coronavirus’, ‘covid’, ‘clinical trial’ and ‘randomized controlled trial’ from January 2020 to June 2021.
